        <a href="/2020/02/08/1852" rel="permalink">Aladdin’ was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. ‘Aladdin’ was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys, which I loved. It wasn’t a princess or a girl beating the odds it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.;Zachary Levi;amazing 2584;I believe in incentivizing people. If you can incentivize people in anything, whether it’s in politics in life in spirituality in business just take care of folks. Incentivize them and all of a sudden it’s amazing the difference that you’ll see.;Zachary Levi;amazing 2585;I’ll watch a Pixar movie over and over and over again. I’ll be with friends of mine who have kids, that want to watch ‘Finding Nemo,’ and I’m like, ‘Yeah, okay, let’s watch ‘Nemo’ again, for the seven billionth time!,’ because they’re amazing movies.;Zachary Levi;amazing 2586;In my fifty years of experience and memory, I have seen the most amazing increase in the standard of living of a people ever achieved anywhere in the world. This is why I am so sure that our system of free competition and industrial development is sound and must be preserved.;Charles E. Wilson;amazing 2587;I’m very concerned for the future of the earth and its amazing creatures. We’ve got to be careful and make sure we don’t foul our own nest.;John Lithgow;amazing 2588;One of the most amazing things I got from the film, so much green screen, there are so many moments and it really taught me about how important it is to have an intention when flying, when going somewhere and having an intention.;Brandon Routh;amazing 2589;It was a great mantel to be able to take on really, an amazing legacy. And you know to finally see it, because I just saw the final product yesterday as well, is really amazing to be part of something like this.;Brandon Routh;amazing 2590;Christopher Reeve did such an amazing job that to give him some kind of accent or more bravado would have been wrong. Audiences wouldn’t have responded to that either.;Brandon Routh;amazing 2591;But as far as, for I think it will be amazing you know where I find myself years from now because of this film. It’s just amazing, I think everybody’s going to kind of know this film and because of it, me. So I you know it’s crazy.;Brandon Routh;amazing 2592;I have my favourite fashion decade, yes, yes, yes: ’60s. It was a sort of little revolution the clothes were amazing but not too exaggerated.;Valentino Garavani;amazing 2593;For years, I never knowingly went on a holiday. When I travelled, it was for work. Now I am a huge advocate, particularly to places which have amazing wildlife, such as Antarctica, India and Patagonia.;Miranda Richardson;amazing 2594;Dick Van Dyke was my first idol. He’s an amazing physical comedian, like a classic clown, but also very smart and not afraid to show vulnerability.;Douglas Wood;amazing 2595;I’d love to work with Sufjan Stevens. He so gets it. He’s amazing.;Lee DeWyze;amazing 2596;It’s really sad looking at people like Lindsay Lohan. She’s an amazing actress, but you see what happens when people know too much about your personal life. They start not being able to look at you the same way professionally. I don’t want that to happen to me.;Dianna Agron;amazing 2597;I just wanna give a big shout out to all the fans out there who have followed my work up until now. You guys are amazing!! Hearing from fans is the best feeling in the world.;Lindsey Shaw;amazing 2598;Fame and stuff like that is all very cool, but at the end of the day, we’re all human beings. Although what I do is incredibly surreal and fun and amazing and I’m really grateful for it, I don’t believe my own press release, do you know what I mean?;Tom Hardy;amazing 2599;Our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination… a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there’s still time to influence how that future will play out.;Karen Thompson Walker;amazing 2600;I left my job in the fall, and now I can set my life up around writing instead of squeezing writing into my day it’s amazing to have that time, and I feel very lucky.;Karen Thompson Walker;amazing 2601;I feel like writing a book there’s always a version in your head that’s an amazing version, but then you write the version that you can write.;Karen Thompson Walker;amazing 2602;As an editor, I read Charlotte Rogan’s amazing debut novel, ‘The Lifeboat,’ when it was still in manuscript. I read it in one night, and I really wanted my company to publish it, but we lost it to another house. It’s such a wonderful combination of beautiful writing and suspenseful storytelling.;Karen Thompson Walker;amazing 2603;I am also hugely excited to then be competing to defend my three Paralympic titles at the Paralympic Games. I believe we will see some amazing times posted and I am very much looking forward to what will be an incredible Olympics and Paralympics in London.;Oscar Pistorius;amazing 2604;But I’m trying not to be cynical - I don’t want to be one of those people who has a cool opportunity and blows it. It’s really amazing what’s happening to me.;Shannyn Sossamon;amazing 2605;My favorite laser disk ever was the laser disk for The Graduate, which had a commentary track that wasn’t even the filmmakers, it was a professor, some film criticism guy who just happen to be this amazing commentator who went off into the whole theory of comedy.;Jay Roach;amazing 2606;I think that marriage is an amazing institution and should be preserved, and you can have great marriages, and you must because sharing your life with someone is like the greatest thing. And I loved being able to set a good example for that on television.;Jenna Elfman;amazing 2607;We used to go to Studio 54 - an amazing place.;Jerry Hall;amazing 2608;Yeah, I’ve worked with a couple of female directors, now, and I think that they’re amazing. As good or better than guy directors.;Alia Shawkat;amazing 2609;We shouldn’t feel restricted by our sexuality, and our sexuality doesn’t have to be a cultural choice. That’s an amazing variety of music within those five main performers.;Neil Tennant;amazing 2610;Hollywood is the place to be for actors - and there’s just a big rush when an Australian comes over just because there’s less of them. I guess that’s just how it is. Like if you pick a pink jellybean out of a jar of green ones it’d be amazing, but if you pick a green one, no one will care.;Callan McAuliffe;amazing 2611;What’s great about TV, and what I love about being on ‘Parenthood,’ is you have this family. I’m now going on four years of working with the same 100 people, and that helps you feel like your life has more roots. It’s more conducive to having a family, and you’re staying in town. So that part is amazing.;Dax Shepard;amazing 2612;When you’re true to who you are, amazing things happen.;Deborah Norville;amazing 2613;Children are amazing, and while I go to places like Princeton and Harvard and Yale, and of course I teach at Columbia, NYU, and that’s nice and I love students, but the most fun of all are the real little ones, the young ones.;David Dinkins;amazing 2614;I’ve been given an amazing opportunity and I could not be more grateful. But I also know that all this will eventually die off. It’s not real.

Second, I never dreamed about that I just dreamed about making movies with Tarantino. So if I can make movies with a lot of amazing directors - yes.;Melanie Laurent;amazing 2617;Because I’ve made a film with such an amazing director as Tarantino, I’m much more conscious of working with good directors from now on, so that’s what’s important to me. I don’t really care about making a big movie - I just want to make good ones.;Melanie Laurent;amazing 2618;Don’t count out other amazing programming like Frontline. You will still find more hours of in-depth news programming, investigative journalism and analysis on PBS than on any other outlet.;Gwen Ifill;amazing 2619;It’s amazing what some people read into songs.;Richard Thompson;amazing 2620;I walked to Seward School first through fourth grade.

It’s amazing.;Joe Lando;amazing 2627;The son has always felt like he was a footnote in one of the stories the father tells. The father is an amazing storyteller and one of the tales that he tells is how he met his wife.;Danny DeVito;amazing 2628;I think Serena Williams is the best tennis player of this generation, if not the best ever. It is amazing for her to be playing as well as she is at the age of 31.;Samantha Stosur;amazing 2629;Receiving the Newcombe Medal for a third year in a row is an amazing honour. The Newcombe Medal is a great occasion for the Australian tennis community to come together and celebrate our sport, recognise people’s achievements and contributions to Australian tennis.;Samantha Stosur;amazing 2630;I had an amazing childhood.;Abbie Cornish;amazing 2631;But it was great, we sit in the same dressing room where, like, Johnny Cash sat and Willie Nelson and all those guys. That was in itself something amazing - I was on the same space these guys stood on, ya know?;Alan Vega;amazing 2632;United Artists wanted to do records with me. I had no idea, what a rare thing that was… to make an album. And they put a guy with me working on songs, and I got busy with films. I just kind of let it slide. Isn’t that amazing?;John Astin;amazing 2633;Paul Farmer has helped to build amazing health care system in one of the poorest areas of Haiti.

There weren’t too many stunts, just some doubling.;Christopher Parker;amazing 2638;Moby Dick - that book is so amazing.

You can be chatting with her and when they call action, she’s right there.;Lisa Kudrow;amazing 2640;My sister Jennifer is an Emmy winning journalist and mother of three amazing girls.

But I have one bracelet that never comes off my wrist.;Rachael Taylor;amazing 2644;Los Angeles is a very magical place when you take the entertainment industry out of it. You have beautiful beaches and amazing mountains here. I’m a big rock climber. I head out into the mountains whenever I have free time. It’s amazing.;Alex Pettyfer;amazing 2645;My heart is so light that it’s amazing. I get to play all this grief, all this loss, all this disaster and chaos. It’s hysterically funny.

It was pretty amazing that I got to travel the world with someone like her.;Harry Shum, Jr.;amazing 2648;If Martin Scorsese calls, I am available.

Let me help you look even better.’ I think tearing someone down is an awful thing to do. It has a lasting impression on people.;Carson Kressley;amazing 2658;I think one of the coolest things about the job is the level of trust we have for each other. The actors fully trust that the writers will write amazing episodes, and the writers trust that the actors will follow their instincts with the characters.;John Krasinski;amazing 2659;Trophies and medals have never meant much to me. I’ve had amazing experiences, which let you feel like you’ve accomplished something.;John Krasinski;amazing 2660;Most of the people I know who work out seriously do so because they have such an amazing outlook on life.

So I decided to place them in a discreet location, such as the inside part of my bicep.;Jake Owen;amazing 2674;In editing, it’s amazing how you choose the in and out points.

It’s an amazing experience. It’s like the characters have come alive and are sitting on my shoulder talking to me, telling me their tales.;R. A. Salvatore;amazing 2676;A million words were going through my head and honestly I didn’t say one of them. I wanted to let it sit, simmer, you know I wanted to soak it all in - the moment was amazing.;Stefano Langone;amazing 2677;I mean, the whole idea of movies was it was special to go to see - you went to a movie theater to see something that was magical and amazing, in a very special location.;Bob Balaban;amazing 2678;I started walking at night with my sister in law which has been amazing.

But I’m not passionate about acting the way you probably should be to call yourself an actor.;Evangeline Lilly;amazing 2691;I was interested in transcendence from a very early age.
