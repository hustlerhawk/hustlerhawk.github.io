My blood alone remains: take it, but do not make me suffer long.;Marie Antoinette;alone 1259;I just don’t want to die alone, that’s all. That’s not too much to ask for, is it It would be nice to have someone care about me, for who I am, not about my wallet.;Richard Pryor;alone 1260;There is no end of craving.

White;alone 1263;Down to Gehenna, or up to the Throne, He travels the fastest who travels alone.;Rudyard Kipling;alone 1264;No woman can be handsome by the force of features alone, any more that she can be witty by only the help of speech.;Kin Hubbard;alone 1265;Music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content, and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness, as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever.;Peabo Bryson;alone 1266;If we take science as our sole guide, if we accept and hold fast that alone which is verifiable, the old theology must go.;John Burroughs;alone 1267;Time alone reveals the just man but you might discern a bad man in a single day.;Sophocles;alone 1268;What is the worst of woes that wait on age?

And this gives you the opportunity to plan the time management of the entire day.;Menachem Mendel Schneerson;alone 1274;Music is amazing.

Buck;alone 1282;Compassion alone stands apart from the continuous traffic between good and evil proceeding within us.;Eric Hoffer;alone 1283;The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable - and it is not carried forward by our power alone.
