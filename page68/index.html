        <a href="/2020/02/08/9389" rel="permalink">Aladdin’ was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. ‘Aladdin’ was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys, which I loved. It wasn’t a princess or a girl beating the odds it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.;Zachary Levi;cool 11125;Films are really cool because, every couple months, or however many times you can get a job because there’s a lot of luck involved in that, you’re playing a different character.;Zachary Levi;cool 11126;I met Drew Barrymore in New York and she said she liked the band. That was really cool. I grew up on her.;Meg White;cool 11127;It’s cool to meet your idols. It’s a good opportunity to travel. Those kinds of things are good.;Meg White;cool 11128;Country’s hip it’s cool music.;Ricky Skaggs;cool 11129;I have snakes, three sharks, moray eels, piranhas, five scorpions and a bird spider. All of them are predators. They are dangerous but it’s cool to have strong and powerful pets.;Tracy Morgan;cool 11130;So when I got to be about 13 or 14, I started listening - even though my parents music was way cool - to contemporary hard rock at that time, which was Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Ted Nugent and all that, and that’s just where I came from.;Slash;cool 11131;I even knew some of the dialogue but it was definitely cool to look at. We always argue that the movies should be loyal but in this case I could argue that it might have been too loyal.;Todd McFarlane;cool 11132;I’m a guy who likes to watch something cool, creepy and suspenseful and there is no show to watch as an adult that would scare me at for even four seconds.;Todd McFarlane;cool 11133;Our mission for younger people is to do our best to make exercise cool, hip - the thing to do.;Bruce Jenner;cool 11134;I think when you’re winning, your uniforms are cool.;Shaun Alexander;cool 11135;I really, really love Hilary Clinton. I think she’s very cool. She’s out there and she’s involved.;Sandra Bernhard;cool 11136;It’s cool when your husband starts to sing some old Merle Haggard song and I can pop in with a harmony and it doesn’t sound too bad.;Trisha Yearwood;cool 11137;Doing charity work is always cool. It’s always a good thing.;Lee DeWyze;cool 11138;I definitely wasn’t cool in high school. I really wasn’t. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas. But I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things.;Dianna Agron;cool 11139;In New York City, you can walk down the street and see a girl in a trench who looks equally as cool as a girl wearing Lululemon. It’s like you’re watching models. You see a little of everything right by you.;Hoda Kotb;cool 11140;The sexiest thing about style is if you kind of just take your personality and put it in what you wear. That’s what I think is cool.;Jessica Szohr;cool 11141;Fame and stuff like that is all very cool, but at the end of the day, we’re all human beings. Although what I do is incredibly surreal and fun and amazing and I’m really grateful for it, I don’t believe my own press release, do you know what I mean?;Tom Hardy;cool 11142;I’m not a guy who curses very much in my personal life. When I curse it sounds like a kid trying to be cool. But I think there are quite a few people, my father being one of them, who use curse words rather eloquently.;Justin Halpern;cool 11143;The cool thing about being a songwriter, or a writer, I guess, in general, you can take on a lot of different things, experience a lot of different things, just by writing about them.;Amos Lee;cool 11144;Melanie Fiona is a singer, a songwriter, she’s a super-girl. I can be silly, goofy, really chilled. She’s like your cool chill girlfriend, sister-friend. I’m just like everybody else.;Melanie Fiona;cool 11145;I don’t need to hang out in a posse and try to act cool.;Jeremy London;cool 11146;THE GODS was my first professional band and I learned a lot during that time. It was very cool playing with so many great musicians as it helped me to learn.;Ken Hensley;cool 11147;But I’m trying not to be cynical - I don’t want to be one of those people who has a cool opportunity and blows it. It’s really amazing what’s happening to me.;Shannyn Sossamon;cool 11148;Never judge someone by who he’s in love with judge him by his friends. People fall in love with the most appalling people. Take a cool, appraising glance at his pals.;Cynthia Heimel;cool 11149;And I now think that Stratocasters and Telecasters are way cool.;John Fogerty;cool 11150;There’s a power in women being women. There’s a role for men, but we don’t have to be men, because we’re women. I think that representing that on television is a cool thing.;Jenna Elfman;cool 11151;If you’re a kid who’s not necessarily attractive, and you don’t have money, and you’re not hip and cool, chances are you’re not going to feel good about yourself and want to be an actor.;Jim McKay;cool 11152;Like I said about Freaked, people tend to find these films, and I think that in the end the cool thing about a movie is that it can be sort of burnt temporarily, but then it’s burnt into the fabric of your culture.;Alex Winter;cool 11153;The second we see somebody on the street or meet someone, we make snap judgments about them, about who they are and why we wouldn’t necessarily sit with them or why we would or what’s cool or not cool.;Max Cannon;cool 11154;Labels don’t mean anything to me. I’m trying to play as passionately as I’m able to. If they want to call that cool, that’s fine. Just spell the name right, is the formula.;Lee Konitz;cool 11155;I’m pretty content with what I have, but the one thing that I don’t have is something like the iPod - but PC-based. I think that would be cool.;Oren Peli;cool 11156;You get to bring your own sound system when you play an arena, all the lights and visual stuff, which I think is really cool. There’s something about those old arenas, where it feels larger than life.;Dan Auerbach;cool 11157;All the bands get along really well. That’s one of the biggest things on a tour. It’s great to get all these cool bands together, but if they don’t get along it sucks.;Brandon Thomas;cool 11158;The frustrating part of it is that you’re generally known for what you did last. I’ve had the privilege of doing some very cool independent films that, a lot of the time, the general public doesn’t see unless you’re at a film festival or you’re into that kind of movie.;Hayden Panettiere;cool 11159;For too long, our country’s version of an energy policy has consisted of Americans waking up every day and wondering how much it will cost to drive to work, how much it will cost to keep their business running, how much it will cost to heat or cool their homes.;Bob Beauprez;cool 11160;David Lynch and I almost made a movie together in the late ’80s. We had lots of dinners and lunches. He’s a very cool, hip guy. This film, let’s face it, is like an homage to him, I would imagine he’d find it funny.;Martin Short;cool 11161;I like rhythmic things that butt up against each other in a cool kind of way.;Stone Gossard;cool 11162;And I remember as a second or third grader having some autonomy to go to the store if I felt like it, walk home, take my time, kick the can. We were on our own schedule after school, so that was cool.;Stone Gossard;cool 11163;If I could have anyone on speed dial it would be George Clooney. He seems like a cool guy who would give good advice.;Adam Garcia;cool 11164;When you see people who are really good at game shows, the one common attribute is a cool head under pressure: an ability to perform as well in the studio, surrounded by lights and noise, as you do on your couch.;Ken Jennings;cool 11165;I get around OK with a toolbox. As a kid, I picked up skills following my dad through the oil fields of Oklahoma and West Texas. My wife Janine is hard to impress, but she does think it’s cool when I fix things around the house.;Ronnie Dunn;cool 11166;I think movies glamorize violence, in the sense that they make it in a way that it’s either cool or funny.;Matthew Vaughn;cool 11167;I mean, you have a general tone of it but it’s pretty much you get to come in and you’re going to flip this car and it’s going to blow up and you’re going to come out on fire and you go oh, that’s cool, and then you get paid a lot of money.;David R. Ellis;cool 11168;They had some really cool rigged cars and things that were different that they would tow behind the camera car that were actually on these trailers that manipulated side to side and stuff like they were getting hit, and actually put the actor right in the middle of the chase.;David R. Ellis;cool 11169;When you’re in Los Angeles, nobody bats an eye, they’re so used to seeing actors, they just act really cool.;Luke Wilson;cool 11170;I’m always looking for cool stuff to do because that’s what we’re supposed to do, ya know?;Joshua Homme;cool 11171;I think it’s interesting to have a cool character not look so cool, you know?;Norman Reedus;cool 11172;You can’t not look cool with a crossbow.;Norman Reedus;cool 11173;If I could work with any actor it would have to be Johnny Depp. He is cool.;Ben Nicholas;cool 11174;It is really cool to have created a movie that has turned out to become the biggest movie of the year.;Michael Bay;cool 11175;Well, we played with Soul Coughing once for like two days, that was pretty cool. I mean they were all good, you can pull a great experience from everything.;Mike Lowry;cool 11176;It’s a really cool time for artists who want to strive for a little more depth in what they want to say to come forward. We live in a very fast world right now. We’ve got all this media and music which is so accessible to us, it’s here one minute gone the next.;Kimbra;cool 11177;We’re gonna try and bring on all the different aspects of horror movie making and bring on guests and show all these old ‘50’s B movies. Not the real corny ones, the real cool ones.;Jerry Only;cool 11178;It’s kinda cool seeing people having real fights with people they really know.;Ron Livingston;cool 11179;I want kids of this generation to see that everything is cool, that there’s some kind of unity in hip-hop. We all found something that’s really important to us, and music is all we’ve really got.;Missy Elliot;cool 11180;I jumped off a cliff backwards for ‘I Am Number Four,’ which was pretty cool. I’d never done that before. It took seven takes from different angles and luckily there were no injuries. I came close, though. My head nearly hit the rock at one point.;Alex Pettyfer;cool 11181;We had a huge audience, we sold truckloads of albums. If we do something that’s cool, people will listen to it. If we don’t, we would be selling people short.;Andy Taylor;cool 11182;I don’t particularly dislike any kind of person that might be reading my stuff. They like it and that’s cool, but I don’t do the work for any kind of group in particular, except for hobos, who just plain kick ass and light up my life.;Jhonen Vasquez;cool 11183;Obviously anything that accessorizes or enhances the iPhone is always pretty cool.;Harry Shum, Jr.;cool 11184;I was asked to do a test commercial shoot for an Apple product which didn’t mean much to me at the time. Some music player that holds all your songs. Sounded cool to me and I never gave up an opportunity to work, especially with the possibility of it turning into a national commercial. Coolest job I did in that time.;Harry Shum, Jr.;cool 11185;It’s a beautiful thing, diving into the cool crisp water and then just sort of being able to pull your body through the water and the water opening up for you.;Dawn Fraser;cool 11186;Sunday school don’t make you cool forever.;Sly Stone;cool 11187;I don’t think a show’s ever changed networks in the middle of the season before, but it was cool because they gave us those extra couple years of life that was necessary to get us to syndication.;Donal Logue;cool 11188;I think as - all in all, it’s better to have a cool president than a not cool president.;Jonah Goldberg;cool 11189;But if the choice is a cool president and 8 or 10 percent unemployment in a declining economy and a country that seems to be going in the wrong direction and structural unemployment for young people at 50 percent, I’d rather have a dorky president who fixed those problems.;Jonah Goldberg;cool 11190;Doing something that warrants the attention of the President of the United States is super cool.;Michael K. Williams;cool 11191;You get to actually see the music video on the TV in the pilot and we have the soundtrack playing at this big party.

Harrison Ford was so cool when he had the whip, and Bruce Lee was such an artist that you couldn’t take your eyes off of him.;Lucy Liu;cool 11194;The cool thing about writing music, writing anything, is that once you publish it, it’s there forever.;Ryan Tedder;cool 11195;I am super-proud to have a sort of famous character in my background that if you’re a certain age, he was probably a part of your youth. I think that’s pretty cool.;Adam Brody;cool 11196;I have been in teen shows for years, so doing that stuff - kissing - is kind of commonplace and not a big deal. It was way more cool just because it was Meg Ryan.;Adam Brody;cool 11197;I think some people record songs and make records a certain way to cater to radio. If you’re born to make commercial music that’s cool. But if you’re born to not make commercial records, maybe you’re meant to cater to another market.;Bryan White;cool 11198;It was cool to do someone else’s movie. It was a lot of fun.;Jason Mewes;cool 11199;In an online community, there’s this kind of social economy between the community members.

For them it’s like a treasure hunt, you know.;Will Wright;cool 11201;I never really loved school through junior high, but then I started running track my freshman year, and I was just like, ‘Wow, this is cool!
