        <a href="/2020/02/08/11785" rel="permalink">When I was younger, I wasn’t concentrating on good days. I was managing a career and trying to have a good year. It would always ‘lead’ to something, which never leads to anything except death, where everything leads to. And then as I got older, and then I had my kids and everything, I began to appreciate a great Wednesday.

        <a href="/2020/02/08/11780" rel="permalink">Hamlet’ is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper. All the big, unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death what’s real and not real. All these subjects can literally drive you mad.;Michael Sheen;death 14070;If we openly declare what is wrong with us, what is our deepest need, then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear.;J. B. Priestley;death 14071;The most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination.;George Meredith;death 14072;To be immortal is commonplace except for man, all creatures are immortal, for they are ignorant of death what is divine, terrible, incomprehensible, is to know that one is immortal.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14073;Life and death have been lacking in my life.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14074;Ultimately life is disease, death and oblivion. It’s still better than high school.;Dan Savage;death 14075;My children are magical creatures and I love them to death.;Jack Black;death 14076;But then I’m one of those guys that is still a bit afraid of the telephone, its implications for conversation. I still wonder if the jukebox might be the death of live music.;Tom Waits;death 14077;Perhaps we don’t need these religious concoctions to pillow the fear of death. Just the fact that there is an unknown, and something greater, can bring a feeling of peace. That’s enough for me.;Brad Pitt;death 14078;If a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club, they’d starve to death.;Sam Snead;death 14079;In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can’t even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn’t have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;death 14080;Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.;Michael Collins;death 14081;I don’t think I would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties. There’s always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent.;Jesse Ventura;death 14082;I hit rock bottom, but thank God my bottom wasn’t death.;Stevie Ray Vaughan;death 14083;In an artwork you’re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.;Damien Hirst;death 14084;Since I was a child, death is definitely something that I think about every day. But I think that everybody does. You try and avoid it, but it’s such a big thing that you can’t.;Damien Hirst;death 14085;The difference between art about death and actual death is that one’s a celebration and the other’s a dull fact.;Damien Hirst;death 14086;I was taught to confront things you can’t avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you’re trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy. The fact that flowers don’t last for ever makes them beautiful.;Damien Hirst;death 14087;I wouldn’t feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I’d be bored to death.;Joaquin Phoenix;death 14088;It’s not life or death it’s a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser.;Bernhard Langer;death 14089;Miller didn’t write Death of a Salesman. He released it. It was there inside him, waiting to be turned loose. That’s the measure of its merit.;Elia Kazan;death 14090;Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.;Georg Hermes;death 14091;I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn’t. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;death 14092;I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world. There is a death wish, a perverse death wish. Not just for ourselves, not just for the movie ‘Death Wish,’ but for the end of all human life.;John Hodgman;death 14093;When you think about it, the end of the world is a little bit like death: We all know it’s going to come eventually, and as we get older, we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly.;John Hodgman;death 14094;I try to write lyrics so that they won’t age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.;Florence Welch;death 14095;A friend said to me, ‘Be glad for your troubles - they strengthen you.’ Well, if that’s the truth, I’m going to be so strong they’ll have to beat me to death!;Sonia Johnson;death 14096;She goes through the vale of death alone, each time a babe is born. As it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal, so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it.;Margaret Sanger;death 14097;Emigration is no longer a solution it’s a defeat. People are risking death, drowning every day, but they’re knocking on doors that are not open.;Tahar Ben Jelloun;death 14098;In Goddess religion death is not feared, but is understood to be a part of life, followed by birth and renewal.;Carol P. Christ;death 14099;Death’s an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.;Ivan Turgenev;death 14100;Feminists bore me to death. I follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way, great. But I’d rather they saw it more as a lesson about following their own instincts rather than imitating somebody.;Bjork;death 14101;No real English gentleman, in his secret soul, was ever sorry for the death of a political economist.;Walter Bagehot;death 14102;There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death 14103;Vets do what doctors used to - diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death.;Jane Smiley;death 14104;Somehow, knowing that Alzheimer’s is coming mocks all one’s aspirations - to tell stories, to think through certain issues as only a novel can do, to be recognised for one’s accomplishments and hard work - in a way that old familiar death does not.;Jane Smiley;death 14105;We should weep for men at their birth, not at their death.;Charles de Montesquieu;death 14106;You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.;Ian Fleming;death 14107;I think when you’re 10 years old, it’s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode. Kids are better left naive about certain things.;J. J. Abrams;death 14108;I love myself. Anything that has my name I’m tickled to death.;Barbara Corcoran;death 14109;Sin brought death, and death will disappear with the disappearance of sin.;Mary Baker Eddy;death 14110;There is nothing glamorous about death.;Roger Moore;death 14111;My book ‘Trust Your Heart’, which is the story of my life, will be followed by ‘Singing Lessons’, a memoir of love, loss, hope, and healing, which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy.;Judy Collins;death 14112;Defeat the fear of death and welcome the death of fear.;G. Gordon Liddy;death 14113;The coward sneaks to death the brave live on.;George Sewell;death 14114;Only those who spread treachery, fire, and death out of hatred for the prosperity of others are undeserving of pity.;Jose Marti;death 14115;If the heart stops for more than two minutes, you have massive brain death. There are only two minutes between our conscious world and zero. That’s how fragile our consciousness is.;Robin Gibb;death 14116;The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!;Heather Mills;death 14117;I believe in the institution of marriage. Of course being a Mormon, we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part. If you really try hard, if you make it work, it’s blissful. But I also know a marriage that isn’t working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn’t have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother’s death. The renewed energy, the surprising sweetness of grief. The tenderness I feel for strangers on walkers. The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.;Mary Schmich;death 14119;You haven’t lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.;Vance Havner;death 14120;I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.;Nancy Reagan;death 14121;As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring.;Hulk Hogan;death 14122;I have had death threats from people with fixations.;Enya;death 14123;Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.;Hilaire Belloc;death 14124;People who are sick, or who have been sick, or have come close to death have a lot to say - and they want you to hear it.;Anna Deavere Smith;death 14125;Living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life. It helps you to live a less trivial life.;Sogyal Rinpoche;death 14126;The line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do.;Bear Grylls;death 14127;Bulls can do nothing to demand justice.

But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.
