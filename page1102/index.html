        <a href="/2020/02/08/31109" rel="permalink">Peace Train’ is a song I wrote, the message of which continues to breeze thunderously through the hearts of millions. There is a powerful need for people to feel that gust of hope rise up again.;Cat Stevens;hope 36245;We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation.;Ivan Illich;hope 36246;Acting is something I love. It’s a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don’t think it’s any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life, I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.;Hugh Jackman;hope 36247;I think, my generation, it’s hard to have hope when you got a $700-trillion derivatives debt to pay and a bubble about to explode and $500 trillion worth of GDP.;Shia LaBeouf;hope 36248;But maybe music was not intended to satisfy the curious definiteness of man. Maybe it is better to hope that music may always be transcendental language in the most extravagant sense.;Charles Ives;hope 36249;I’m going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it, but I’m going home right now.;Benjamin Day;hope 36250;In a mood of faith and hope my work goes on. A ream of fresh paper lies on my desk waiting for the next book. I am a writer and I take up my pen to write.;Pearl S. Buck;hope 36251;To Live signifies to believe and hope - to lie and to lie to oneself.;Emile M. Cioran;hope 36252;We would not be interested in human beings if we did not have the hope of someday meeting someone worse off than ourselves.;Emile M. Cioran;hope 36253;I would hope they would be our fellow artists, rather than trying to emulate or idolize clowns like us.;Maynard James Keenan;hope 36254;But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one.;Marco Rubio;hope 36255;My mother was one of seven girls whose parents went to bed hungry so their children wouldn’t. My father lost his mother when he was nine. He left school and went to work for the next 70 years. They emigrated to America with little more than the hope of a better life.;Marco Rubio;hope 36256;Hope and Change has become Divide and Conquer.;Marco Rubio;hope 36257;The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we hope to bring about through those lives.;Audre Lorde;hope 36258;Evil communication corrupts good manners. I hope to live to hear that good communication corrects bad manners.;Benjamin Banneker;hope 36259;I hope that the mistakes made and suffering imposed upon Japanese Americans nearly 60 years ago will not be repeated against Arab Americans whose loyalties are now being called into question.;Daniel Inouye;hope 36260;Beware how you take away hope from any human being.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;hope 36261;Well, what was called the blessed hope of the Bible is that one day Jesus Christ would come back again, start a whole new era, that this world order that we know it would change into something that would be wonderful that we’d call the millennium.;Pat Robertson;hope 36262;A person, who no matter how desperate the situation, gives others hope, is a true leader.;Daisaku Ikeda;hope 36263;My hope is that we continue to nurture the places that we love, but that we also look outside our immediate worlds.;Annie Leibovitz;hope 36264;The media tried to destroy my parents and has taken things completely out of context, but there’s not a whole lot you can do in terms of fighting back. You have to hope that it passes, which it always does. But they have to be careful. They didn’t necessarily sign up for this.;Katy Perry;hope 36265;One thing I can’t do, and I hope that there are other people out there that feel the same way, is climb a rope. Oh my gosh, it’s so hard to climb rope! It’s all about grip and arms.;Katy Perry;hope 36266;I hope the seeds I have sown will be taken up by those who will follow me because the journey I have begun cannot be undertaken in isolation.;Evelyn Glennie;hope 36267;Love, hope, fear, faith - these make humanity These are its sign and note and character.;Robert Browning;hope 36268;And as far as false hope, there is no such thing. There is only hope or the absence of hope-nothing else.;Patti Davis;hope 36269;I hope my tongue in prune juice smothers, If I belittle dogs and mothers.;Ogden Nash;hope 36270;But groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind worth having.;John Perry Barlow;hope 36271;Armageddon is not around the corner. This is only what the people of violence want us to believe. The complexity and diversity of the world is the hope for the future.;Michael Palin;hope 36272;I want you to take away the hope because that’s the thing that’s killing me.;Denis Leary;hope 36273;Unless our conception of patriotism is progressive, it cannot hope to embody the real affection and the real interest of the nation.;Jane Addams;hope 36274;A lot of presidential memoirs, they say, are dull and self-serving. I hope mine is interesting and self-serving.;William J. Clinton;hope 36275;I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses.;Rick Perry;hope 36276;My deal is have a flat, simple tax. And - Americans want - Americans I hope - aspire to be - be wealthy. I hope they aspire to have a better quality of life. And we have this class warfare that’s going on now. And I don’t agree with that.

Clinton;hope 36304;My hope is that that person will come forward that can win the presidency that we can all get behind.;Rick Perry;hope 36305;We’ve got the wind at our back right now.

All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope 36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure.

People say, ‘Studs, you’re an optimist.’ I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what’s the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.
