I’m addicted to spending and big government.’ I’d like one of them just to stand up and say that.;Glenn Beck;government 30268;If the jury have no right to judge of the justice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect the people against the oppressions of the government for there are no oppressions which the government may not authorize by law.;Lysander Spooner;government 30269;There is nothing inherently fair about equalizing incomes. If the government penalizes you for working harder than somebody else, that is unfair.

Brooks;government 30270;The office of government is not to confer happiness, but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves.;William Ellery Channing;government 30271;Wherever magistrates were appointed from among those who complied with the injunctions of the laws, Socrates considered the government to be an aristocracy.;Xenophon;government 30272;The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.;William Jennings Bryan;government 30273;Good government is the outcome of private virtue.;John Jay Chapman;government 30274;Our citizens are tired of big government raising their taxes and cooking up new ways to micromanage their lives, our citizens are tired of big government killing jobs with their do-gooder policies. In short the people are Fed Up!;Rick Perry;government 30275;Conservatives are winning offices, and champions of big government are cleaning out their desks right now.;Rick Perry;government 30276;America’s greatness is not found in the size of its government. America’s greatness resides in the hearts and the minds of the people.;Rick Perry;government 30277;Morals are in all countries the result of legislation and government they are not African or Asian or European: they are good or bad.;Denis Diderot;government 30278;Public confidence in the integrity of the Government is indispensable to faith in democracy and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for.;Adlai E. Stevenson;government 30279;History proves that all dictatorships, all authoritarian forms of government are transient. Only democratic systems are not transient. Whatever the shortcomings, mankind has not devised anything superior.;Vladimir Putin;government 30280;The government is not your salvation. The government is not your road to prosperity. Hard work, education will take you far beyond what any government program can ever promise.;Mia Love;government 30281;Folks, this government isn’t too big to fail, it’s too big to succeed.;Sarah Palin;government 30282;Every government must consider the security of the country. That is just part of the responsibilities of any government. But true security can only come out of unity within a country where there are so many ethnic nationalities.;Aung San Suu Kyi;government 30283;All that a good government aims at… is to add no unnecessary and artificial aid to the force of its own unavoidable consequences, and to abstain from fortifying and accumulating social inequality as a means of increasing political inequalities.;James F. Cooper;government 30284;There is something fundamentally unfair about a government that takes away so much of people’s money, power, and personal control while telling them that life will be better as a result.;Steve Forbes;government 30285;I would have been glad to have lived under my wood side, and to have kept a flock of sheep, rather than to have undertaken this government.;Oliver Cromwell;government 30286;If I had been under ObamaCare, and a beaurocrat had been trying to tell me when I could get that CT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could based upon my timetable, and not the government’s timetable. That’s what saved my life.;Herman Cain;government 30287;I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.;Madeleine Albright;government 30288;I wasn’t a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn’t written nine zillion books. I was a hands-on professor.;Madeleine Albright;government 30289;The measure of a man is not how great his faith is, but how great his love is. We must not let government programs disconnect our souls from each other.;J. C. Watts;government 30290;Every American, regardless of their background, has the right to live free of unwarranted government intrusion. Repealing the worst provisions of the Patriot Act will reign in this gross abuse of power and restore to everyone our basic Constitutional rights.;Pete Stark;government 30291;The conservative movement today is like that tall ship with its proud captain: strong, accomplished but veering off course into the dangerous and uncharted waters of big government republicanism.;Mike Pence;government 30292;It is unfortunate that Americans are no longer aware of what the constitution says and what their rights are.

Brandeis;government 30297;A world in which government is burdened by historic debt, philanthropy has limited resources, and the private sector is only interested in its own personal gain is simply unsustainable.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30298;Corporations often partner with government after natural disasters, as many companies did in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As a rule, however, long-term civic/corporate partnerships are still rare .But this need not remain the status quo, as many opportunities are available for such partnerships.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30299;The United States is at a critical juncture in time. Our government is riddled with historic debt, and the limited resources of philanthropic and non-profit efforts cannot meet the scale of social challenges we face with necessary force.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30300;It is time for corporate America to become ‘the third pillar’ of social change in our society, complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy. We need the entire private sector to begin committing itself not just to making profits, but to fulfilling higher and larger purposes by contributing to building a better world.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30301;Non-disclosure in the Internet Age is quickly perceived as a breach of trust. Government, corporations and each of us as individuals must recalibrate how we live and share our lives appropriate to the information now available and the expectations of others.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30302;It is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.;William E. Gladstone;government 30303;I don’t believe that government is good at picking technology, particularly technology that is changing. By the time you get it done and go through democracy, it’s so outdated.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30304;The average Nigerian person has come to reconcile himself with the fact that his or her social progress remain essentially in his or her hands in collaboration with other fellow Nigerians and not merely relying on what government alone could provide for him or her.;Ibrahim Babangida;government 30305;If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.;Frank Herbert;government 30306;You can’t have it both ways. You can’t tell me that you’re taxed enough already, and that you want constitutional government and then in the next breath say, ‘Bring me home some bacon.’ The pig has been picked clean.;Rand Paul;government 30307;In Michigan, a liberal democrat raised taxes and kept their government programs at the same level. And guess what? Their economy continued into the toilet, it continued down.;Rick Perry;government 30308;This administration in Washington that’s in power now clearly believes that government is not only the answer to every need, but it’s the most qualified to make the most central decisions for every American in every area.;Rick Perry;government 30309;Our goal is to displace the entrenched powers in Washington, restore the rightful balance between the state and federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30310;When the good lord calls you home, the government ought not come get your home.;Rick Perry;government 30311;President Obama’s call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.;Rick Perry;government 30312;Americans want government that is leaner, more efficient, and less intrusive into their personal lives.;Rick Perry;government 30313;Who can be against progress, after all? But it’s a fraudulent use of the word - because for the Progressive, progress is marked not be how free you are, but how much government can ‘do’ for you.;Rick Perry;government 30314;It is through states that the American people get the job done every day, often in spite of a deeply flawed bureaucratic federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30315;We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.;Rick Perry;government 30316;The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a free government.;Sam Houston;government 30317;People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can’t fix.;Sarah Palin;government 30318;New York State is upside down and backwards high taxes and low performance. The New York State government was at one time a national model. Now, unfortunately, it’s a national disgrace. Sometimes, the corruption in Albany could even make Boss Tweed blush.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30319;Too often government responds to the whispers of lobbyists before the cries of the people.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30320;I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn’t possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There’s a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government 30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves… when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government 30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government 30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government 30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.;Jim DeMint;government 30325;The three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are one, Security to possessors two, facility to acquirers and three, hope to all.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;government 30326;The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.;Tom Coburn;government 30327;Ours is a government of checks and balances. The Mafia and crooked businessmen make out checks, and the politicians and other compromised officials improve their bank balances.;Steve Allen;government 30328;Democrats believe that the federal government is not our enemy, it’s our partner.;George McGovern;government 30329;Every time the government grows we lose more of who we are.;Glenn Beck;government 30330;Candidly, I believe most corporations actually don’t mind big government.;Rick Santorum;government 30331;When a nation is over-reliant on one or two commodities like oil or precious minerals, corrupt government ministers and their dodgy associates hoard profits and taxes instead of properly allocating them to schools and hospitals.;Bono;government 30332;The goal to strive for is a poor government but a rich people.;Andrew Johnson;government 30333;I think it true that, you know, sometimes things start to change even before a government changes and, actually, I think you can begin to see even the Labour machine beginning to understand that it has become over-reliant on targets and processes, that local governments have been over-bossed and bullied.;David Cameron;government 30334;I don’t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I have changed government policy solely because of a contribution.;William J. Clinton;government 30335;My philosophy is not a bean-counting, accounting ‘look at this.’ It is a philosophy that smaller government is better government, and government that is closer to the people is best of all.;John Bolton;government 30336;Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It’s a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.;John Podhoretz;government 30338;The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system. Nothing of the sort had ever been done before, and it was done spit spot with very little national debate.;John Podhoretz;government 30340;Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction.;Charles Horton Cooley;government 30341;We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention.

We haven’t heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists. Everybody’s afraid of the government and there’s no need soft peddling it, it’s the truth.

If they haven’t lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven’t lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something’s wrong, it’s government’s job to fix it, it must be government that’s responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government 30358;Government shouldn’t tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can’t even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government 30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government 30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion.

The federal government’s top priority right now should be the cleanup. And BP certainly has done so many things wrong. They need to be held to account.;Carly Fiorina;government 30370;But ours was intended to be a citizen government. It is what of, by and for the people means.

And it shouldn’t be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton’s successor in the White House, George W.

It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O. Douglas;government 30401;Concerns about the size and role of government are what seem to leave reformers stammering and speechless in town-hall meetings.

One of the factors that explained the difference was contracting.;Thomas Frank;government 30404;Our laws governing lobbying and campaign contributions have struck the right balance between the wishes of the people and those of private industry, so why are we so quick to doubt that the same great results can be achieved by putting the government’s justice-dealing branch on the same market-based course?;Thomas Frank;government 30405;We have mountain of debt that isn’t going away and all the problems are here to stay, and anybody who tells you that is a good thing ought to get out of the business of helping the government down the road.;Rick Santelli;government 30406;Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government.;Mary Wollstonecraft;government 30407;The Right’s view of government and the Left’s view of big business are both correct.;Robert Anton Wilson;government 30408;Government is necessary for our survival.

I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could based upon my timetable, and not the government’s timetable. That’s what saved my life.;Herman Cain;government 30287;I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.;Madeleine Albright;government 30288;I wasn’t a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn’t written nine zillion books.

We must not let government programs disconnect our souls from each other.;J. C.

As a rule, however, long-term civic/corporate partnerships are still rare .But this need not remain the status quo, as many opportunities are available for such partnerships.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30299;The United States is at a critical juncture in time.

But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate.

Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system.

If they haven’t lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven’t lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something’s wrong, it’s government’s job to fix it, it must be government that’s responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government 30358;Government shouldn’t tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can’t even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government 30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government 30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion.

And it shouldn’t be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton’s successor in the White House, George W.

It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O. Douglas;government 30401;Concerns about the size and role of government are what seem to leave reformers stammering and speechless in town-hall meetings.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Hello my name is the Republican Party and I got a problem. I’m addicted to spending and big government.’ I’d like one of them just to stand up and say that.;Glenn Beck;government 30268;If the jury have no right to judge of the justice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect the people against the oppressions of the government for there are no oppressions which the government may not authorize by law.;Lysander Spooner;government 30269;There is nothing inherently fair about equalizing incomes. If the government penalizes you for working harder than somebody else, that is unfair. If you save your money but retire with the same pension as a free-spending neighbor, that is also unfair.;Arthur C. Brooks;government 30270;The office of government is not to confer happiness, but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves.;William Ellery Channing;government 30271;Wherever magistrates were appointed from among those who complied with the injunctions of the laws, Socrates considered the government to be an aristocracy.;Xenophon;government 30272;The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.;William Jennings Bryan;government 30273;Good government is the outcome of private virtue.;John Jay Chapman;government 30274;Our citizens are tired of big government raising their taxes and cooking up new ways to micromanage their lives, our citizens are tired of big government killing jobs with their do-gooder policies. In short the people are Fed Up!;Rick Perry;government 30275;Conservatives are winning offices, and champions of big government are cleaning out their desks right now.;Rick Perry;government 30276;America’s greatness is not found in the size of its government. America’s greatness resides in the hearts and the minds of the people.;Rick Perry;government 30277;Morals are in all countries the result of legislation and government they are not African or Asian or European: they are good or bad.;Denis Diderot;government 30278;Public confidence in the integrity of the Government is indispensable to faith in democracy and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for.;Adlai E. Stevenson;government 30279;History proves that all dictatorships, all authoritarian forms of government are transient. Only democratic systems are not transient. Whatever the shortcomings, mankind has not devised anything superior.;Vladimir Putin;government 30280;The government is not your salvation. The government is not your road to prosperity. Hard work, education will take you far beyond what any government program can ever promise.;Mia Love;government 30281;Folks, this government isn’t too big to fail, it’s too big to succeed.;Sarah Palin;government 30282;Every government must consider the security of the country. That is just part of the responsibilities of any government. But true security can only come out of unity within a country where there are so many ethnic nationalities.;Aung San Suu Kyi;government 30283;All that a good government aims at… is to add no unnecessary and artificial aid to the force of its own unavoidable consequences, and to abstain from fortifying and accumulating social inequality as a means of increasing political inequalities.;James F. Cooper;government 30284;There is something fundamentally unfair about a government that takes away so much of people’s money, power, and personal control while telling them that life will be better as a result.;Steve Forbes;government 30285;I would have been glad to have lived under my wood side, and to have kept a flock of sheep, rather than to have undertaken this government.;Oliver Cromwell;government 30286;If I had been under ObamaCare, and a beaurocrat had been trying to tell me when I could get that CT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could based upon my timetable, and not the government’s timetable. That’s what saved my life.;Herman Cain;government 30287;I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.;Madeleine Albright;government 30288;I wasn’t a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn’t written nine zillion books. I was a hands-on professor.;Madeleine Albright;government 30289;The measure of a man is not how great his faith is, but how great his love is. We must not let government programs disconnect our souls from each other.;J. C. Watts;government 30290;Every American, regardless of their background, has the right to live free of unwarranted government intrusion. Repealing the worst provisions of the Patriot Act will reign in this gross abuse of power and restore to everyone our basic Constitutional rights.;Pete Stark;government 30291;The conservative movement today is like that tall ship with its proud captain: strong, accomplished but veering off course into the dangerous and uncharted waters of big government republicanism.;Mike Pence;government 30292;It is unfortunate that Americans are no longer aware of what the constitution says and what their rights are. Because of that, we are often very passive about what happens when the government violates those rights.;James Bovard;government 30293;The fundamental purpose of government is to protect its citizens.;Arlen Specter;government 30294;The relationships that people have - that are sexual, psychological, emotional - these relationships are not open to supervision by parents, schools, churches, or government. Nobody has any right to intervene at all in any kind of relationship like that.;Madalyn Murray O’Hair;government 30295;The thought about Republicans is, we’re supposed to be Jeffersonian. That government governs the best that governs the least.;Pat Robertson;government 30296;To declare that in the administration of criminal law the end justifies the means to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribution.;Louis D. Brandeis;government 30297;A world in which government is burdened by historic debt, philanthropy has limited resources, and the private sector is only interested in its own personal gain is simply unsustainable.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30298;Corporations often partner with government after natural disasters, as many companies did in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As a rule, however, long-term civic/corporate partnerships are still rare .But this need not remain the status quo, as many opportunities are available for such partnerships.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30299;The United States is at a critical juncture in time. Our government is riddled with historic debt, and the limited resources of philanthropic and non-profit efforts cannot meet the scale of social challenges we face with necessary force.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30300;It is time for corporate America to become ‘the third pillar’ of social change in our society, complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy. We need the entire private sector to begin committing itself not just to making profits, but to fulfilling higher and larger purposes by contributing to building a better world.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30301;Non-disclosure in the Internet Age is quickly perceived as a breach of trust. Government, corporations and each of us as individuals must recalibrate how we live and share our lives appropriate to the information now available and the expectations of others.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30302;It is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.;William E. Gladstone;government 30303;I don’t believe that government is good at picking technology, particularly technology that is changing. By the time you get it done and go through democracy, it’s so outdated.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30304;The average Nigerian person has come to reconcile himself with the fact that his or her social progress remain essentially in his or her hands in collaboration with other fellow Nigerians and not merely relying on what government alone could provide for him or her.;Ibrahim Babangida;government 30305;If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.;Frank Herbert;government 30306;You can’t have it both ways. You can’t tell me that you’re taxed enough already, and that you want constitutional government and then in the next breath say, ‘Bring me home some bacon.’ The pig has been picked clean.;Rand Paul;government 30307;In Michigan, a liberal democrat raised taxes and kept their government programs at the same level. And guess what? Their economy continued into the toilet, it continued down.;Rick Perry;government 30308;This administration in Washington that’s in power now clearly believes that government is not only the answer to every need, but it’s the most qualified to make the most central decisions for every American in every area.;Rick Perry;government 30309;Our goal is to displace the entrenched powers in Washington, restore the rightful balance between the state and federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30310;When the good lord calls you home, the government ought not come get your home.;Rick Perry;government 30311;President Obama’s call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.;Rick Perry;government 30312;Americans want government that is leaner, more efficient, and less intrusive into their personal lives.;Rick Perry;government 30313;Who can be against progress, after all? But it’s a fraudulent use of the word - because for the Progressive, progress is marked not be how free you are, but how much government can ‘do’ for you.;Rick Perry;government 30314;It is through states that the American people get the job done every day, often in spite of a deeply flawed bureaucratic federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30315;We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.;Rick Perry;government 30316;The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a free government.;Sam Houston;government 30317;People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can’t fix.;Sarah Palin;government 30318;New York State is upside down and backwards high taxes and low performance. The New York State government was at one time a national model. Now, unfortunately, it’s a national disgrace. Sometimes, the corruption in Albany could even make Boss Tweed blush.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30319;Too often government responds to the whispers of lobbyists before the cries of the people.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30320;I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn’t possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There’s a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government 30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves… when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government 30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government 30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government 30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.;Jim DeMint;government 30325;The three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are one, Security to possessors two, facility to acquirers and three, hope to all.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;government 30326;The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.;Tom Coburn;government 30327;Ours is a government of checks and balances. The Mafia and crooked businessmen make out checks, and the politicians and other compromised officials improve their bank balances.;Steve Allen;government 30328;Democrats believe that the federal government is not our enemy, it’s our partner.;George McGovern;government 30329;Every time the government grows we lose more of who we are.;Glenn Beck;government 30330;Candidly, I believe most corporations actually don’t mind big government.;Rick Santorum;government 30331;When a nation is over-reliant on one or two commodities like oil or precious minerals, corrupt government ministers and their dodgy associates hoard profits and taxes instead of properly allocating them to schools and hospitals.;Bono;government 30332;The goal to strive for is a poor government but a rich people.;Andrew Johnson;government 30333;I think it true that, you know, sometimes things start to change even before a government changes and, actually, I think you can begin to see even the Labour machine beginning to understand that it has become over-reliant on targets and processes, that local governments have been over-bossed and bullied.;David Cameron;government 30334;I don’t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I have changed government policy solely because of a contribution.;William J.

But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It’s a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.;John Podhoretz;government 30338;The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system. Nothing of the sort had ever been done before, and it was done spit spot with very little national debate.;John Podhoretz;government 30340;Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction.;Charles Horton Cooley;government 30341;We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention.

And is his leadership style more like Bill Clinton’s, or Abraham Lincoln’s?;Thomas Frank;government 30342;The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color. The government lied.;Jeremiah Wright;government 30343;I hate Iran. I hate the Iranian government. It’s a cruel and evil government.;Doris Lessing;government 30344;The soldiers never explained to the government when an Indian was wronged, but reported the misdeeds of the Indians.;Geronimo;government 30345;I ran for president in order to be able to try to change Washington D.C. from the inside. Our federal government is broken.;Herman Cain;government 30346;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;government 30347;I’ve always been about less government.;Kelly Clarkson;government 30348;The design of Rhetoric is to remove those Prejudices that lie in the way of Truth, to Reduce the Passions to the Government of Reasons to place our Subject in a Right Light, and excite our Hearers to a due consideration of it.;Mary Astell;government 30349;The chief duty of government is to keep the peace and stand out of the sunshine of the people.;James A.

We haven’t heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists. Everybody’s afraid of the government and there’s no need soft peddling it, it’s the truth. It is the truth.;Steve Wynn;government 30353;Higher taxes is the road to ruin. We must and we will shrink our government, and that means making some tough choices, tightening our belts.;Chris Christie;government 30354;I think the country’s getting disgusted with Washington partly because of the decline of civility in government.;George McGovern;government 30355;A president who breaks the law is a threat to the very structure of our government.;Al Gore;government 30356;The public is upset. If they haven’t lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven’t lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something’s wrong, it’s government’s job to fix it, it must be government that’s responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government 30358;Government shouldn’t tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can’t even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government 30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government 30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion. And in politics it’s always about the next challenge.;Tony Blair;government 30362;The Republican form of government is the highest form of government: but because of this it requires the highest type of human nature, a type nowhere at present existing.;Herbert Spencer;government 30363;Old forms of government finally grow so oppressive that they must be thrown off even at the risk of reigns of terror.;Herbert Spencer;government 30364;One side of the American psyche wants smaller government, lower taxes, and more choices for individuals, even if those choices increase risk. The other wants a strong social safety net to protect the weakest among us, even if it costs more to minimize risk.;Ron Fournier;government 30365;I do not intend to dispute in any way the need for defence cuts and the need for government spending cuts in general. I do not share a not in my backyard approach to government spending reductions.;Stephen Harper;government 30366;The government can only be brought down because it alienates several parties in the House.;Stephen Harper;government 30367;Whether Canada ends up as o-ne national government or two national governments or several national governments, or some other kind of arrangement is, quite frankly, secondary in my opinion.;Stephen Harper;government 30368;Canadians know that the promise of a recession didn’t happen because of anything we did here. If you look at all the causes of the recession, problems in mortgage markets, the problems in the banking sector, the problems in government finance in countries like Greece, none of those problems were in present Canada.;Stephen Harper;government 30369;Well, you know, I - again, even in the context of BP, I wonder about this government’s priorities. The federal government’s top priority right now should be the cleanup. And BP certainly has done so many things wrong. They need to be held to account.;Carly Fiorina;government 30370;But ours was intended to be a citizen government. It is what of, by and for the people means. And when our most important issue in California is the creation of jobs, I think it’s quite helpful to have someone in the U.S. Senate or in the governor’s seat who actually knows where jobs come from.;Carly Fiorina;government 30371;We need more transparency and accountability in government so that people know how their money is being spent. That means putting budgets online, putting legislation online.;Carly Fiorina;government 30372;The truth is in California you can’t build a new manufacturing facility, and businesses are leaving in droves because of bad government policy.;Carly Fiorina;government 30373;It’s the federal government’s job to secure the border.;Carly Fiorina;government 30374;Whatever government is not a government of laws, is a despotism, let it be called what it may.;Daniel Webster;government 30375;It is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It is equally true that that government is best which provides most.;Walter Lippmann;government 30376;If it were not for the government, we should have nothing to laugh at in France.;Nicolas Chamfort;government 30377;I am very much opposed to abortion personally. But I don’t think it is the government’s rule.;Arlen Specter;government 30378;Where might is mixed with wit, there is too good an accord in a government.;Elizabeth I;government 30379;But I think it’s up to a local congregation to determine whether or not a marriage should be blessed of God. And it shouldn’t be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton’s successor in the White House, George W. Bush, was committed to expanding government spending for faith-based initiatives.;Tony Campolo;government 30387;A tiny and closed fraternity of privileged men, elected by no one, and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by government.;Spiro T. Agnew;government 30388;I have no doubt that the government of this great nation will work with its people to lead New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back to an enlightened, proud, safe part of the world.;Harry Connick, Jr.;government 30389;Well, again, a gun sale database is just trying to get the Department of Justice to keep track of the guns that they’re purchasing and supplying to drug dealers and murderers. I mean, wow. Come on, let’s get the government under control before we start restricting the rights of - innocent citizens.;John Mica;government 30390;I work for a Government I despise for ends I think criminal.;John Maynard Keynes;government 30391;Well, I have a CBE and I accepted it with glee because it’s not bestowed on you by the royal family, it’s not bestowed on you by the government, you have to be nominated by the public.;Rod Stewart;government 30392;Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.;Edward Gibbon;government 30393;I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than ten military divisions.;Vaclav Havel;government 30394;Well, I thought the deal was, when you went to work for the government you weren’t supposed to make money!;Joe Biden;government 30395;Our future cannot depend on the government alone. The ultimate solutions lie in the attitudes and the actions of the American people.;Joe Biden;government 30396;This is a generation weaned on Watergate, and there is no presumption of innocence and no presumption of good intentions. Instead, there is a presumption that, without relentless scrutiny, the government will misbehave.;Dee Dee Myers;government 30397;Television of course actually started in Britain in 1936, and it was a monopoly, and there was only one broadcaster and it operated on a license which is not the same as a government grant.;David Attenborough;government 30398;What the Founding Fathers created in the Constitution is the most magnificent government on the face of the Earth, and the reason is this: because it was intended to preserve the American society and the American spirit, not to transform it or destroy it.;Mark Levin;government 30399;It is from weakness that people reach for dictators and concentrated government power. Only the strong can be free. And only the productive can be strong.;Wendell Willkie;government 30400;The Constitution is not neutral.

There's a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government 30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves... when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government 30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government 30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government 30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit.

It is a philosophy that smaller government is better government, and government that is closer to the people is best of all.;John Bolton;government 30336;Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn't in recess is neither rational nor moderate.

Such a thing has never happened and can't be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system.

They need to be held to account.;Carly Fiorina;government 30370;But ours was intended to be a citizen government. It is what of, by and for the people means.

And it shouldn't be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton's successor in the White House, George W.

It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O. Douglas;government 30401;Concerns about the size and role of government are what seem to leave reformers stammering and speechless in town-hall meetings.

Their economy continued into the toilet, it continued down.;Rick Perry;government 30308;This administration in Washington that's in power now clearly believes that government is not only the answer to every need, but it's the most qualified to make the most central decisions for every American in every area.;Rick Perry;government 30309;Our goal is to displace the entrenched powers in Washington, restore the rightful balance between the state and federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30310;When the good lord calls you home, the government ought not come get your home.;Rick Perry;government 30311;President Obama's call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.;Rick Perry;government 30312;Americans want government that is leaner, more efficient, and less intrusive into their personal lives.;Rick Perry;government 30313;Who can be against progress, after all? But it's a fraudulent use of the word - because for the Progressive, progress is marked not be how free you are, but how much government can 'do' for you.;Rick Perry;government 30314;It is through states that the American people get the job done every day, often in spite of a deeply flawed bureaucratic federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30315;We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.;Rick Perry;government 30316;The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a free government.;Sam Houston;government 30317;People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can't fix.;Sarah Palin;government 30318;New York State is upside down and backwards high taxes and low performance.

I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There's a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government 30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves... when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government 30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government 30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government 30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.;Jim DeMint;government 30325;The three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are one, Security to possessors two, facility to acquirers and three, hope to all.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;government 30326;The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.;Tom Coburn;government 30327;Ours is a government of checks and balances.

Clinton;government 30335;My philosophy is not a bean-counting, accounting 'look at this.' It is a philosophy that smaller government is better government, and government that is closer to the people is best of all.;John Bolton;government 30336;Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn't in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It's a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.;John Podhoretz;government 30338;The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can't be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system.

If they haven't lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven't lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something's wrong, it's government's job to fix it, it must be government that's responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government 30358;Government shouldn't tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can't even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government 30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government 30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion.

And it shouldn't be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton's successor in the White House, George W.

Only the strong can be free. And only the productive can be strong.;Wendell Willkie;government 30400;The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O. Douglas;government 30401;Concerns about the size and role of government are what seem to leave reformers stammering and speechless in town-hall meetings. The right wants to have a debate over fundamental principles elected Democrats seem incapable of giving it to them.;Thomas Frank;government 30402;Government is, by its very nature, a destroyer of liberties the Obama administration, specifically, is promising to interfere with the economy and the health care system so profoundly that Washington will soon have us all in chains.;Thomas Frank;government 30403;Under the administration of George W. Bush, you will recall, federal spending grew pretty significantly. At the same time, the number of people directly employed by the federal government shrank. One of the factors that explained the difference was contracting.;Thomas Frank;government 30404;Our laws governing lobbying and campaign contributions have struck the right balance between the wishes of the people and those of private industry, so why are we so quick to doubt that the same great results can be achieved by putting the government's justice-dealing branch on the same market-based course?;Thomas Frank;government 30405;We have mountain of debt that isn't going away and all the problems are here to stay, and anybody who tells you that is a good thing ought to get out of the business of helping the government down the road.;Rick Santelli;government 30406;Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government.;Mary Wollstonecraft;government 30407;The Right's view of government and the Left's view of big business are both correct.;Robert Anton Wilson;government 30408;Government is necessary for our survival. We need government in order to survive. The Founding Fathers created a special place for government. It is called the Constitution.;Michael Badnarik;government 30409;In a democracy, citizens pass judgment on their government, and if they are kept in the dark about what their government is doing, they cannot be in a position to make well-grounded decisions.;Peter Singer;government 30410;I believed the only thing that could turn around this government spending and mounting debt would be if the people rose up.;Jim DeMint;government 30411;The corporations don't have to lobby the government anymore.

And I'm not sure where it comes from, but I suspect it's got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.;Alan Greenspan;government 30423;Taxes are like abortion, and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You're for them or against them. Taxes go up or down government raises taxes or lowers them. But Democrats will not let the words 'abortion' or 'tax hikes' pass their lips.;Ann Coulter;government 30424;Also, when you escape a Communist regime, you treasure liberty and you understand that as government and state expand, liberty must contract.;Dennis Prager;government 30425;For a country to have a great writer is like having a second government.

30313;Who can be against progress, after all? But it’s a fraudulent use of the word - because for the Progressive, progress is marked not be how free you are, but how much government can ‘do’ for you.;Rick Perry;government
30314;It is through states that the American people get the job done every day, often in spite of a deeply flawed bureaucratic federal government.;Rick Perry;government
30315;We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.;Rick Perry;government
30316;The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a free government.;Sam Houston;government
30317;People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can’t fix.;Sarah Palin;government
30318;New York State is upside down and backwards high taxes and low performance. The New York State government was at one time a national model. Now, unfortunately, it’s a national disgrace. Sometimes, the corruption in Albany could even make Boss Tweed blush.;Andrew Cuomo;government
30319;Too often government responds to the whispers of lobbyists before the cries of the people.;Andrew Cuomo;government
30320;I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn’t possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There’s a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government
30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves… when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government
30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government
30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government
30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.;Jim DeMint;government
30325;The three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are one, Security to possessors two, facility to acquirers and three, hope to all.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;government
30326;The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.;Tom Coburn;government
30327;Ours is a government of checks and balances. The Mafia and crooked businessmen make out checks, and the politicians and other compromised officials improve their bank balances.;Steve Allen;government
30328;Democrats believe that the federal government is not our enemy, it’s our partner.;George McGovern;government
30329;Every time the government grows we lose more of who we are.;Glenn Beck;government
30330;Candidly, I believe most corporations actually don’t mind big government.;Rick Santorum;government
30331;When a nation is over-reliant on one or two commodities like oil or precious minerals, corrupt government ministers and their dodgy associates hoard profits and taxes instead of properly allocating them to schools and hospitals.;Bono;government
30332;The goal to strive for is a poor government but a rich people.;Andrew Johnson;government
30333;I think it true that, you know, sometimes things start to change even before a government changes and, actually, I think you can begin to see even the Labour machine beginning to understand that it has become over-reliant on targets and processes, that local governments have been over-bossed and bullied.;David Cameron;government
30334;I don’t believe you can find any evidence of the fact that I have changed government policy solely because of a contribution.;William J. Clinton;government
30335;My philosophy is not a bean-counting, accounting ‘look at this.’ It is a philosophy that smaller government is better government, and government that is closer to the people is best of all.;John Bolton;government
30336;Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government
30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It’s a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.;John Podhoretz;government
30338;The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government
30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system. Nothing of the sort had ever been done before, and it was done spit spot with very little national debate.;John Podhoretz;government
30340;Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction.;Charles Horton Cooley;government
30341;We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention. And our designated opinion leaders want to know: Is Obama up this week? Is he down? And is his leadership style more like Bill Clinton’s, or Abraham Lincoln’s?;Thomas Frank;government
30342;The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color. The government lied.;Jeremiah Wright;government
30343;I hate Iran. I hate the Iranian government. It’s a cruel and evil government.;Doris Lessing;government
30344;The soldiers never explained to the government when an Indian was wronged, but reported the misdeeds of the Indians.;Geronimo;government
30345;I ran for president in order to be able to try to change Washington D.C. from the inside. Our federal government is broken.;Herman Cain;government
30346;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;government
30347;I’ve always been about less government.;Kelly Clarkson;government
30348;The design of Rhetoric is to remove those Prejudices that lie in the way of Truth, to Reduce the Passions to the Government of Reasons to place our Subject in a Right Light, and excite our Hearers to a due consideration of it.;Mary Astell;government
30349;The chief duty of government is to keep the peace and stand out of the sunshine of the people.;James A. Garfield;government
30350;Man, I don’t want to have nothing to do with computers. I don’t want the government in my business.;Erykah Badu;government
30351;Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;government
30352;The guy keeps making speeches about redistribution and maybe we ought to do something to businesses that don’t invest, their holding too much money. We haven’t heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists. Everybody’s afraid of the government and there’s no need soft peddling it, it’s the truth. It is the truth.;Steve Wynn;government
30353;Higher taxes is the road to ruin. We must and we will shrink our government, and that means making some tough choices, tightening our belts.;Chris Christie;government
30354;I think the country’s getting disgusted with Washington partly because of the decline of civility in government.;George McGovern;government
30355;A president who breaks the law is a threat to the very structure of our government.;Al Gore;government
30356;The public is upset. If they haven’t lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven’t lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something’s wrong, it’s government’s job to fix it, it must be government that’s responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government
30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government
30358;Government shouldn’t tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government
30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can’t even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government
30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government
30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion. And in politics it’s always about the next challenge.;Tony Blair;government
30362;The Republican form of government is the highest form of government: but because of this it requires the highest type of human nature, a type nowhere at present existing.;Herbert Spencer;government
30363;Old forms of government finally grow so oppressive that they must be thrown off even at the risk of reigns of terror.;Herbert Spencer;government
30364;One side of the American psyche wants smaller government, lower taxes, and more choices for individuals, even if those choices increase risk. The other wants a strong social safety net to protect the weakest among us, even if it costs more to minimize risk.;Ron Fournier;government
30365;I do not intend to dispute in any way the need for defence cuts and the need for government spending cuts in general. I do not share a not in my backyard approach to government spending reductions.;Stephen Harper;government
30366;The government can only be brought down because it alienates several parties in the House.;Stephen Harper;government
30367;Whether Canada ends up as o-ne national government or two national governments or several national governments, or some other kind of arrangement is, quite frankly, secondary in my opinion.;Stephen Harper;government
30368;Canadians know that the promise of a recession didn’t happen because of anything we did here. If you look at all the causes of the recession, problems in mortgage markets, the problems in the banking sector, the problems in government finance in countries like Greece, none of those problems were in present Canada.;Stephen Harper;government
30369;Well, you know, I - again, even in the context of BP, I wonder about this government’s priorities. The federal government’s top priority right now should be the cleanup. And BP certainly has done so many things wrong. They need to be held to account.;Carly Fiorina;government
30370;But ours was intended to be a citizen government. It is what of, by and for the people means. And when our most important issue in California is the creation of jobs, I think it’s quite helpful to have someone in the U.S. Senate or in the governor’s seat who actually knows where jobs come from.;Carly Fiorina;government
30371;We need more transparency and accountability in government so that people know how their money is being spent. That means putting budgets online, putting legislation online.;Carly Fiorina;government
30372;The truth is in California you can’t build a new manufacturing facility, and businesses are leaving in droves because of bad government policy.;Carly Fiorina;government
30373;It’s the federal government’s job to secure the border.;Carly Fiorina;government
30374;Whatever government is not a government of laws, is a despotism, let it be called what it may.;Daniel Webster;government
30375;It is perfectly true that that government is best which governs least. It is equally true that that government is best which provides most.;Walter Lippmann;government
30376;If it were not for the government, we should have nothing to laugh at in France.;Nicolas Chamfort;government
30377;I am very much opposed to abortion personally. But I don’t think it is the government’s rule.;Arlen Specter;government
30378;Where might is mixed with wit, there is too good an accord in a government.;Elizabeth I;government
30379;But I think it’s up to a local congregation to determine whether or not a marriage should be blessed of God. And it shouldn’t be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government
30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government
30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government
30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government
30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government
30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government
30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government
30386;Clinton’s successor in the White House, George W. Bush, was committed to expanding government spending for faith-based initiatives.;Tony Campolo;government
30387;A tiny and closed fraternity of privileged men, elected by no one, and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by government.;Spiro T. Agnew;government
30388;I have no doubt that the government of this great nation will work with its people to lead New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back to an enlightened, proud, safe part of the world.;Harry Connick, Jr.;government
30389;Well, again, a gun sale database is just trying to get the Department of Justice to keep track of the guns that they’re purchasing and supplying to drug dealers and murderers. I mean, wow. Come on, let’s get the government under control before we start restricting the rights of - innocent citizens.;John Mica;government
30390;I work for a Government I despise for ends I think criminal.;John Maynard Keynes;government
30391;Well, I have a CBE and I accepted it with glee because it’s not bestowed on you by the royal family, it’s not bestowed on you by the government, you have to be nominated by the public.;Rod Stewart;government
30392;Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.;Edward Gibbon;government
30393;I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words can prove mightier than ten military divisions.;Vaclav Havel;government
30394;Well, I thought the deal was, when you went to work for the government you weren’t supposed to make money!;Joe Biden;government
30395;Our future cannot depend on the government alone. The ultimate solutions lie in the attitudes and the actions of the American people.;Joe Biden;government
30396;This is a generation weaned on Watergate, and there is no presumption of innocence and no presumption of good intentions. Instead, there is a presumption that, without relentless scrutiny, the government will misbehave.;Dee Dee Myers;government
30397;Television of course actually started in Britain in 1936, and it was a monopoly, and there was only one broadcaster and it operated on a license which is not the same as a government grant.;David Attenborough;government
30398;What the Founding Fathers created in the Constitution is the most magnificent government on the face of the Earth, and the reason is this: because it was intended to preserve the American society and the American spirit, not to transform it or destroy it.;Mark Levin;government
30399;It is from weakness that people reach for dictators and concentrated government power. Only the strong can be free. And only the productive can be strong.;Wendell Willkie;government
30400;The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O. Douglas;government
30401;Concerns about the size and role of government are what seem to leave reformers stammering and speechless in town-hall meetings. The right wants to have a debate over fundamental principles elected Democrats seem incapable of giving it to them.;Thomas Frank;government
30402;Government is, by its very nature, a destroyer of liberties the Obama administration, specifically, is promising to interfere with the economy and the health care system so profoundly that Washington will soon have us all in chains.;Thomas Frank;government
30403;Under the administration of George W. Bush, you will recall, federal spending grew pretty significantly. At the same time, the number of people directly employed by the federal government shrank. One of the factors that explained the difference was contracting.;Thomas Frank;government
30404;Our laws governing lobbying and campaign contributions have struck the right balance between the wishes of the people and those of private industry, so why are we so quick to doubt that the same great results can be achieved by putting the government’s justice-dealing branch on the same market-based course?;Thomas Frank;government
30405;We have mountain of debt that isn’t going away and all the problems are here to stay, and anybody who tells you that is a good thing ought to get out of the business of helping the government down the road.;Rick Santelli;government
30406;Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government.;Mary Wollstonecraft;government
30407;The Right’s view of government and the Left’s view of big business are both correct.;Robert Anton Wilson;government
30408;Government is necessary for our survival. We need government in order to survive. The Founding Fathers created a special place for government. It is called the Constitution.;Michael Badnarik;government
30409;In a democracy, citizens pass judgment on their government, and if they are kept in the dark about what their government is doing, they cannot be in a position to make well-grounded decisions.;Peter Singer;government
30410;I believed the only thing that could turn around this government spending and mounting debt would be if the people rose up.;Jim DeMint;government
30411;The corporations don’t have to lobby the government anymore. They are the government.;Jim Hightower;government
30412;If the law is upheld only by government officials, then all law is at an end.;Herbert Hoover;government
30413;A government must not waiver once it has chosen it’s course. It must not look to the left or right but go forward.;Otto von Bismarck;government
30414;The government’s War on Poverty has transformed poverty from a short-term misfortune into a career choice.;Harry Browne;government
30415;Government is force, pure and simple. There’s no way to sugar-coat that. And because government is force, it will attract the worst elements of society - people who want to use government to avoid having to earn their living and to avoid having to persuade others to accept their ideas voluntarily.;Harry Browne;government
30416;I’m not, nor is anybody I know in government part of a nasty right wing clique.;William Hague;government
30417;I think Britain would be alright, if only we had a different Government.;William Hague;government
30418;It is the mission of the next Conservative Government to build the Responsible Society.;William Hague;government
30419;At a time of such hope and optimism in the Middle East, we cannot let the Libyan government violate every principle of international law and human rights with impunity.;William Hague;government
30420;Obviously a Conservative government will always leave taxes lower than they have been under Labour. Those things go with the territory of the Conservative Party.;William Hague;government
30421;I think the way things have been left after Iraq is that people won’t believe the Government of the day, so they have to know that lessons have been learnt and that all political parties and people, whether they were for or against the invasion of Iraq, have learnt lessons.;William Hague;government
30422;I’ve been in and out of Wall Street since 1949, and I’ve never seen the type of animosity between government and Wall Street. And I’m not sure where it comes from, but I suspect it’s got to do with a general schism in this society which is really becoming ever more destructive.;Alan Greenspan;government
30423;Taxes are like abortion, and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You’re for them or against them. Taxes go up or down government raises taxes or lowers them. But Democrats will not let the words ‘abortion’ or ‘tax hikes’ pass their lips.;Ann Coulter;government
30424;Also, when you escape a Communist regime, you treasure liberty and you understand that as government and state expand, liberty must contract.;Dennis Prager;government
30425;For a country to have a great writer is like having a second government. That is why no regime has ever loved great writers, only minor ones.;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn;government
30426;Our government declared that it is conducting some kind of great reforms. In reality, no real reforms were begun and no one at any point has declared a coherent programme.;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn;government
30427;Great re</p>
