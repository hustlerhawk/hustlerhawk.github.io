I hope you can forget it, but I’m going home right now.;Benjamin Day;hope 36250;In a mood of faith and hope my work goes on. A ream of fresh paper lies on my desk waiting for the next book.

They didn’t necessarily sign up for this.;Katy Perry;hope 36265;One thing I can’t do, and I hope that there are other people out there that feel the same way, is climb a rope.

It’s all about grip and arms.;Katy Perry;hope 36266;I hope the seeds I have sown will be taken up by those who will follow me because the journey I have begun cannot be undertaken in isolation.;Evelyn Glennie;hope 36267;Love, hope, fear, faith - these make humanity These are its sign and note and character.;Robert Browning;hope 36268;And as far as false hope, there is no such thing.

And I don’t agree with that. I’m interested in people getting to work.;Rick Perry;hope 36277;Ireland was a place for the renewal of hope and I still see it like that.;Daniel Day-Lewis;hope 36278;Economically, it’s more expensive to make movies. I hope digital movies change that.;Ang Lee;hope 36279;Most of me was glad when my mother died. She was a handful, but not in a cute, festive way.

This begins with corporations that choose to alter how they practice capitalism in two ways to serve the greater good.;Simon Mainwaring;hope 36287;Any institution faces two basic choices if they hope to spark new ideas.

The idea that America is post-racial or post-black because a man I admire, Barack Obama, is president of the United States, is a joke.

Of course, it would have.;Mark Zuckerberg;hope 36332;I hope I die before I get old.;Roger Daltrey;hope 36333;Do the best you can with yourself and hope for the best.;Loretta Lynn;hope 36334;Hope, the best comfort of our imperfect condition.;Edward Gibbon;hope 36335;To withdraw is not to run away, and to stay is no wise action, when there’s more reason to fear than to hope.;Miguel de Cervantes;hope 36336;Hope is the struggle of the soul, breaking loose from what is perishable, and attesting her eternity.;Herman Melville;hope 36337;Good news doesn’t necessarily have to be a positive thing. Bringing good news is imparting hope to one’s fellow man.;Patti Smith;hope 36338;All non-incumbent campaigns promise hope and change, but Obama took the promise to a new level of absurdity.

I don’t think once.;Bob Uecker;hope 36342;When it comes down to it, it’s giving people a good night out in a basic way and I think my company guarantees that.

All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope 36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn’t have to promote myself. These days there’s far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows.

And never hope more than you work.;Rita Mae Brown;hope 36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery’s version of the Barack Obama ‘Hope’ poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

Watts;hope 36402;I mean, why am I considered an ‘it girl?’ Because I’m in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that.

People say, ‘Studs, you’re an optimist.’ I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what’s the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.
