<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>Let God be true but every man a liar’ is the language of true faith.;Aiden Wilson Tozer;faith 19450;In Barack Obama, Democrats have put forth a man of strong religious faith who is comfortable connecting his spiritual life to his public role as a policymaker.;Mike McCurry;faith 19451;Flatter not thyself in thy faith in God if thou hast not charity for thy neighbor.;Francis Quarles;faith 19452;But I don’t necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday.;Miley Cyrus;faith 19453;What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.;Peter Singer;faith 19454;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;faith 19455;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;faith 19456;Skepticism has never founded empires, established principals, or changed the world’s heart. The great doers in history have always been people of faith.;Edwin Hubbel Chapin;faith 19457;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It’s perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19458;The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19459;The great act of faith is when a man decides he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19460;Not truth, but faith, it is that keeps the world alive.;Edna St. Vincent Millay;faith 19461;A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.;Tony Benn;faith 19462;The essential element in personal magnetism is a consuming sincerity - an overwhelming faith in the importance of the work one has to do.;Bruce Barton;faith 19463;By gold all good faith has been banished by gold our rights are abused the law itself is influenced by gold, and soon there will be an end of every modest restraint.;Sextus Propertius;faith 19464;I don’t have faith in young people any more. I don’t waste time trying to communicate with them.;Vivienne Westwood;faith 19465;Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.;Lester B. Pearson;faith 19466;Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19467;The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19468;The saddest thing that befalls a soul is when it loses faith in God and woman.;Alexander Smith;faith 19469;With gridlock the norm, Congress’s approval rating is below 10 percent and the public has lost faith in its national leadership.;Ron Fournier;faith 19470;You can almost see voters nodding their heads at home: The public’s faith in politicians and political institutions has been on a steep and dangerous decline for decades, because elected leaders fail to deliver.;Ron Fournier;faith 19471;I don’t need faith.;Maurice Sendak;faith 19472;To try to fashion something from suffering, to relish our triumphs, and to endure defeats without resentment: all that is compatible with the faith of a heretic.;Walter Kaufmann;faith 19473;Red Letter Christians believe in the doctrines of the Apostle’s Creed, are convinced that the Scriptures have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and make having a personal transforming relationship with the resurrected Christ the touchtone of their faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19474;It’s a new day for the Democrats when it comes to matters of faith, and the younger Evangelicals are aware of this and many of them are moving into the Democratic camp.;Tony Campolo;faith 19475;Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19476;But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.;Mikhail Bakunin;faith 19477;From faith, hope, and love, the virtues of religion referring to God, there arises a double act which bears on the spiritual communion exercised between God and us the hearing of the word and prayer.;William Ames;faith 19478;Religious faith depends on a host of social, psychological and emotional factors that have little or nothing to do with probabilities, evidence and logic.;Michael Shermer;faith 19479;He who is not impressed by sound advice, lacks faith.;Abu Bakr;faith 19480;That someone like Obama could be elected president of the United States - with its unrivaled power and prestige - has begun to restore the country’s and the world’s faith in America as the land of opportunity.;Dee Dee Myers;faith 19481;Faith is not a notion, but a real strong essential hunger, an attracting or magnetic desire of Christ, which as it proceeds from a seed of the divine nature in us, so it attracts and unites with its like.;William Law;faith 19482;I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don’t know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.;Ryan Gosling;faith 19483;Resist your fear fear will never lead to you a positive end. Go for your faith and what you believe.;T. D. Jakes;faith 19484;Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.;J. C. Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;faith 19486;If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.;E. W.

It’s just a matter of where you choose to place that faith.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19489;Over the years my mother’s steadfast faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19490;The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they’re going to do better. That’s why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There’s nobody I don’t say that to.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19491;My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.;Vin Diesel;faith 19492;Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.;Heinrich Heine;faith 19493;Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.;Robert Collier;faith 19494;The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it’s a faith issue, it’s a religious issue.;Jim Wallis;faith 19495;Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;faith 19496;It’s possible that the 2012 general-election race will be the least overtly religious one since 1972, the last campaign before Roe v. Wade and the rise of Jimmy Carter brought evangelicalism into the political mainstream. That’s because faith remains a complicated issue for Obama, who is still wrongly thought to be a Muslim in some quarters.;Jon Meacham;faith 19497;While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith, our politics and our culture are, in the main, less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago. I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith 19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up. I am also a critic of Christianity, if by critic one means an observer who brings historical and literary judgment to bear on the texts and traditions of the church.;Jon Meacham;faith 19499;As crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation, America’s unifying force has never been a specific faith, but a commitment to freedom - not least freedom of conscience.;Jon Meacham;faith 19500;Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.;Jon Meacham;faith 19501;My faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths. We basically work with six popular religions in the world which are the three Abrahamic religions, Hinduism and Buddhism and Sikhism.;Tony Blair;faith 19502;You know, this idea of going around the world imposing democracy by growing a middle-class, a trading merchant class that is independent of your faith, is a good notion, but we’re all partially different - it’s no good imposing systems on people that it doesn’t suit.;Damian Lewis;faith 19503;Writers now are putting total faith in designers at Apple and Amazon. It’s almost like a race-car driver having no input into how cars are designed.;Jonathan Safran Foer;faith 19504;It’s OK to be outspoken about your faith.;Tim Tebow;faith 19505;Stupidity, outrage, vanity, cruelty, iniquity, bad faith, falsehood - we fail to see the whole array when it is facing in the same direction as we.;Jean Rostand;faith 19506;Intelligence must follow faith, never precede it, and never destroy it.;Thomas a Kempis;faith 19507;Used to be, conservatives revered the Average American, that Norman Rockwell oil painting of diner food, humble faith, honest toil, and Capraesque virtue.;James Wolcott;faith 19508;After a decade this glum, we deserved a shot of ‘Glee,’ a show that restored our faith in the power of song, the beauty of dance, and the magic of ‘spirit fingers’ to chase our cares and woes into somebody else’s backyard.;James Wolcott;faith 19509;I have written too much history to have faith in it and if anyone thinks I’m wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.;Henry Adams;faith 19510;No man likes to have his intelligence or good faith questioned, especially if he has doubts about it himself.;Henry Adams;faith 19511;Democrats are people who raise your taxes and spend your money on weird stuff. They steal your guns, and they spit on your faith.;Grover Norquist;faith 19512;Faith in God’s revelation has nothing to do with an ideology which glorifies the status quo.;Karl Barth;faith 19513;For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.;Giacomo Casanova;faith 19514;You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don’t you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I’m a scientist, not a theologian. I don’t know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.;James Lovelock;faith 19516;Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.;Sean Connery;faith 19517;There are so many people that don’t believe in themselves and don’t have faith.;Lenny Kravitz;faith 19518;All an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today, in any scene.;Meryl Streep;faith 19519;From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19520;As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19521;Everything I am I owe to my faith and secondly to parents who were old school.;J.

Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted.;Donald Cram;faith 19535;Until as recently as November of 1966, I had complete faith in the Warren Report. Of course, my faith in the Report was grounded in ignorance, since I had never read it.;Jim Garrison;faith 19536;Ever since the Crusades, when Christians from western Europe were fighting holy wars against Muslims in the near east, western people have often perceived Islam as a violent and intolerant faith - even though when this prejudice took root Islam had a better record of tolerance than Christianity.;Karen Armstrong;faith 19537;I don’t know what religious people do. I kind of wished I’d been a Christian with the blind faith that God is doing the right thing. As a Buddhist, you feel like you have more control over the situation, and that you can change your karma.;Marcia Wallace;faith 19538;The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.;Iain Duncan Smith;faith 19539;Men never cling to their dreams with such tenacity as at the moment when they are losing faith in them, and know it, but do not dare yet to confess it to themselves.;William Graham Sumner;faith 19540;Politicians are usually the first to forget that if you assume someone else is acting in bad faith, they will do the same to you.

So we have faith.;Alice Cooper;faith 19559;If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another mask?;Graham Greene;faith 19560;I am shy to admit that I have followed the advice given all those years ago by a wise archbishop to a bewildered young man: that moments of unbelief ‘don’t matter,’ that if you return to a practice of the faith, faith will return.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19561;I have a disproportionate amount of faith in the goodness of the world and that everything will actually work out okay.;Sloane Crosley;faith 19562;Life is only a long and bitter suicide, and faith alone can transform this suicide into a sacrifice.;Franz Liszt;faith 19563;I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place.;Harriet Beecher Stowe;faith 19564;People will make leaps of faith and get excited by your product if you just get it in front of them.;James Dyson;faith 19565;I want the French people to respect values that allow each individual to practice his or her faith, but in the frame of our common rules of secularism.;Francois Hollande;faith 19566;The abuse of faith has to be resisted precisely.;Joseph Ratzinger;faith 19567;I just can’t say enough about the actors having faith and trust in the writers and the writers having faith and trust in the actors.;Kyle Chandler;faith 19568;Without faith, nothing is possible.

I. Gurdjieff;faith 19575;Faith, sir, we are here today, and gone tomorrow.;Aphra Behn;faith 19576;Earmarks have become a symbol of a Congress that has broken faith with the people.

That’s the place where your dreams will come true. It’s an act of faith now they think that’s going to sort things out.;Jarvis Cocker;faith 19578;Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith, one must first force one’s mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.;Karen Armstrong;faith 19579;The hajj is one of the five essential practices of Islam when they make the pilgrimage to Mecca, Muslims ritually act out the central principles of their faith.;Karen Armstrong;faith 19580;Well, I’ve never left my faith - but have I made a lot of mistakes?

Abrams;faith 19583;Comedy is an escape, not from truth but from despair a narrow escape into faith.;Christopher Fry;faith 19584;We are stronger because we recognize that government isn’t the sole answer to the most important questions, and we welcome community and faith based organizations as partners to serve the needs of Florida families.;Jeb Bush;faith 19585;People with deep faith and big hearts are concerned, as I am about the circumstance that Ms. Schiavo is in. I want them to know I will do what I can, but there are limits to what any particular person - irrespective of the title they currently hold - can do.;Jeb Bush;faith 19586;My faith is the grand drama of my life. I’m a believer, so I sing words of God to those who have no faith.;Olivier Messiaen;faith 19587;It is amazing to think after all that has happened in this country in the last few years, the last few decades, that so many people have this blind faith that government is our friend and therefore, so we don’t need protections against it.;James Bovard;faith 19588;Faith is not a sense, nor sight, nor reason, but taking God at His work.;Faith Evans;faith 19589;That is not to say that we can relax our readiness to defend ourselves.

Nimitz;faith 19590;I think the Hispanic community, the values that resonate in our community, are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family, patriotism.;Ted Cruz;faith 19591;Thank goodness I had a great family growing up, a great foundation.

You have to kind of walk in faith that the next step is going to be just a little bit better than the last step.;Joe Nichols;faith 19602;I always had a really natural faith as a kid.

It has been a quiet strength and a backbone through a lot of difficult times.;Bear Grylls;faith 19608;True fans of the Constitution, like true fans of the national pastime, acknowledge the critical role of human judgment in making tough calls. We don’t expect flawless interpretation. We expect good faith.

The great doers in history have always been people of faith.;Edwin Hubbel Chapin;faith 19457;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith.

Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life.

We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they’re going to do better. That’s why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers.

I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith 19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up.

That is the Christian faith.;Austin Farrer;faith 19612;I never search for a reason why - I have faith in the Lord’s purpose.;Willie Stargell;faith 19613;Since I was an atheist for many years and came to believe in God through my studies in science, it frustrated me to see students and parents who viewed faith and science as enemies.;John Clayton;faith 19614;I’m about as big a star as the Baha’i faith has got, which is pretty pathetic.;Rainn Wilson;faith 19615;There were periods of my life when a lot of people didn’t believe in me. I still had faith in myself. I really had to ask myself life questions. Where do I see myself in five years? Create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. Climb that ladder.;Fergie;faith 19616;The best way is to say that as a Christian for me the essence of Christian faith is that you treat others as if you wish to be treated.;Mike Huckabee;faith 19617;All of my children are ideologically and politically in sync with me, they all have authentic Christian faith. It’s something I’m very grateful for.;Mike Huckabee;faith 19618;I have very little faith that I’ll ever find someone. I’ve had some bad luck and I’ve made some bad choices - not in men, but in how I’ve chosen to deal with relationships.;Selma Blair;faith 19619;In the spiritual body moreover, man appears such as he is with respect to love and faith, for everyone in the spiritual world is the effigy of his own love, not only as to the face and the body, but also as to the speech and the actions.;Emanuel Swedenborg;faith 19620;Faith goes out through the window when beauty comes in at the door.;George Edward Moore;faith 19621;The investigator should have a robust faith - and yet not believe.;Claude Bernard;faith 19622;I am not a great theologian. I know there is a theological concept called invincible ignorance in which a strong enough faith binds you to any facts to the contrary.;Barney Frank;faith 19623;Purity is not imposed upon us as though it were a kind of punishment, it is one of those mysterious but obvious conditions of that supernatural knowledge of ourselves in the Divine, which we speak of as faith. Impurity does not destroy this knowledge, it slays our need for it.;Georges Bernanos;faith 19624;My faith means everything to me. God and I talk constantly.;Sherri Shepherd;faith 19625;As a Christian, there is no other part of the New Right ideology that concerns me more than its self-serving misuse of religious faith.;Mark Hatfield;faith 19626;As a world view, Darwinism cannot of course be refuted, since Faith is, always has been, and always will be, stronger than facts.;Francis Parker Yockey;faith 19627;Film is an illusion. Fame is ephemeral. Faith and family are what endure.;Emilio Estevez;faith 19628;We’re very open and outspoken about our faith and our beliefs. We also talk about our doubts, our moments of insecurities. We talk about it all day, how we’re inspired by God. We recognize">

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Let God be true but every man a liar’ is the language of true faith.;Aiden Wilson Tozer;faith 19450;In Barack Obama, Democrats have put forth a man of strong religious faith who is comfortable connecting his spiritual life to his public role as a policymaker.;Mike McCurry;faith 19451;Flatter not thyself in thy faith in God if thou hast not charity for thy neighbor.;Francis Quarles;faith 19452;But I don’t necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday.;Miley Cyrus;faith 19453;What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.;Peter Singer;faith 19454;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;faith 19455;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;faith 19456;Skepticism has never founded empires, established principals, or changed the world’s heart. The great doers in history have always been people of faith.;Edwin Hubbel Chapin;faith 19457;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It’s perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19458;The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19459;The great act of faith is when a man decides he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19460;Not truth, but faith, it is that keeps the world alive.;Edna St. Vincent Millay;faith 19461;A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.;Tony Benn;faith 19462;The essential element in personal magnetism is a consuming sincerity - an overwhelming faith in the importance of the work one has to do.;Bruce Barton;faith 19463;By gold all good faith has been banished by gold our rights are abused the law itself is influenced by gold, and soon there will be an end of every modest restraint.;Sextus Propertius;faith 19464;I don’t have faith in young people any more. I don’t waste time trying to communicate with them.;Vivienne Westwood;faith 19465;Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.;Lester B. Pearson;faith 19466;Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19467;The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19468;The saddest thing that befalls a soul is when it loses faith in God and woman.;Alexander Smith;faith 19469;With gridlock the norm, Congress’s approval rating is below 10 percent and the public has lost faith in its national leadership.;Ron Fournier;faith 19470;You can almost see voters nodding their heads at home: The public’s faith in politicians and political institutions has been on a steep and dangerous decline for decades, because elected leaders fail to deliver.;Ron Fournier;faith 19471;I don’t need faith.;Maurice Sendak;faith 19472;To try to fashion something from suffering, to relish our triumphs, and to endure defeats without resentment: all that is compatible with the faith of a heretic.;Walter Kaufmann;faith 19473;Red Letter Christians believe in the doctrines of the Apostle’s Creed, are convinced that the Scriptures have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and make having a personal transforming relationship with the resurrected Christ the touchtone of their faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19474;It’s a new day for the Democrats when it comes to matters of faith, and the younger Evangelicals are aware of this and many of them are moving into the Democratic camp.;Tony Campolo;faith 19475;Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19476;But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.;Mikhail Bakunin;faith 19477;From faith, hope, and love, the virtues of religion referring to God, there arises a double act which bears on the spiritual communion exercised between God and us the hearing of the word and prayer.;William Ames;faith 19478;Religious faith depends on a host of social, psychological and emotional factors that have little or nothing to do with probabilities, evidence and logic.;Michael Shermer;faith 19479;He who is not impressed by sound advice, lacks faith.;Abu Bakr;faith 19480;That someone like Obama could be elected president of the United States - with its unrivaled power and prestige - has begun to restore the country’s and the world’s faith in America as the land of opportunity.;Dee Dee Myers;faith 19481;Faith is not a notion, but a real strong essential hunger, an attracting or magnetic desire of Christ, which as it proceeds from a seed of the divine nature in us, so it attracts and unites with its like.;William Law;faith 19482;I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don’t know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.;Ryan Gosling;faith 19483;Resist your fear fear will never lead to you a positive end. Go for your faith and what you believe.;T. D. Jakes;faith 19484;Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.;J. C. Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;faith 19486;If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.;E. W. Howe;faith 19487;One of the embarrassing problems for the early nineteenth-century champions of the Christian faith was that not one of the first six Presidents of the United States was an orthodox Christian.;Mortimer Adler;faith 19488;Evolution and creationism both require faith. It’s just a matter of where you choose to place that faith.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19489;Over the years my mother’s steadfast faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19490;The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they’re going to do better. That’s why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There’s nobody I don’t say that to.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19491;My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.;Vin Diesel;faith 19492;Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.;Heinrich Heine;faith 19493;Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.;Robert Collier;faith 19494;The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it’s a faith issue, it’s a religious issue.;Jim Wallis;faith 19495;Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;faith 19496;It’s possible that the 2012 general-election race will be the least overtly religious one since 1972, the last campaign before Roe v. Wade and the rise of Jimmy Carter brought evangelicalism into the political mainstream. That’s because faith remains a complicated issue for Obama, who is still wrongly thought to be a Muslim in some quarters.;Jon Meacham;faith 19497;While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith, our politics and our culture are, in the main, less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago. I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith 19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up. I am also a critic of Christianity, if by critic one means an observer who brings historical and literary judgment to bear on the texts and traditions of the church.;Jon Meacham;faith 19499;As crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation, America’s unifying force has never been a specific faith, but a commitment to freedom - not least freedom of conscience.;Jon Meacham;faith 19500;Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.;Jon Meacham;faith 19501;My faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths.

It’s almost like a race-car driver having no input into how cars are designed.;Jonathan Safran Foer;faith 19504;It’s OK to be outspoken about your faith.;Tim Tebow;faith 19505;Stupidity, outrage, vanity, cruelty, iniquity, bad faith, falsehood - we fail to see the whole array when it is facing in the same direction as we.;Jean Rostand;faith 19506;Intelligence must follow faith, never precede it, and never destroy it.;Thomas a Kempis;faith 19507;Used to be, conservatives revered the Average American, that Norman Rockwell oil painting of diner food, humble faith, honest toil, and Capraesque virtue.;James Wolcott;faith 19508;After a decade this glum, we deserved a shot of ‘Glee,’ a show that restored our faith in the power of song, the beauty of dance, and the magic of ‘spirit fingers’ to chase our cares and woes into somebody else’s backyard.;James Wolcott;faith 19509;I have written too much history to have faith in it and if anyone thinks I’m wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.;Henry Adams;faith 19510;No man likes to have his intelligence or good faith questioned, especially if he has doubts about it himself.;Henry Adams;faith 19511;Democrats are people who raise your taxes and spend your money on weird stuff. They steal your guns, and they spit on your faith.;Grover Norquist;faith 19512;Faith in God’s revelation has nothing to do with an ideology which glorifies the status quo.;Karl Barth;faith 19513;For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.;Giacomo Casanova;faith 19514;You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don’t you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I’m a scientist, not a theologian. I don’t know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.;James Lovelock;faith 19516;Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.;Sean Connery;faith 19517;There are so many people that don’t believe in themselves and don’t have faith.;Lenny Kravitz;faith 19518;All an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today, in any scene.;Meryl Streep;faith 19519;From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19520;As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19521;Everything I am I owe to my faith and secondly to parents who were old school.;J. C. Watts;faith 19522;It’s a war of attrition. If you have patience and a modicum of faith in yourself your chances are not too bad.;Julie Bowen;faith 19523;I had lost faith in biography.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19524;The Pledge of Allegiance reflects the truth that faith in God has played a significant role in America since the days of the founding of our country.;Randy Neugebauer;faith 19525;If you desire faith, then you have faith enough.;Elizabeth Barrett Browning;faith 19526;I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along.;Bruce Springsteen;faith 19527;For both faith and want of faith have destroyed men alike.;Hesiod;faith 19528;I have faith in the United States and our ability to make good decisions based on the facts.;Al Gore;faith 19529;If you went to your closet today, would you pull out the same outfit you wore 10 or 15 years ago?

Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted.;Donald Cram;faith 19535;Until as recently as November of 1966, I had complete faith in the Warren Report. Of course, my faith in the Report was grounded in ignorance, since I had never read it.;Jim Garrison;faith 19536;Ever since the Crusades, when Christians from western Europe were fighting holy wars against Muslims in the near east, western people have often perceived Islam as a violent and intolerant faith - even though when this prejudice took root Islam had a better record of tolerance than Christianity.;Karen Armstrong;faith 19537;I don’t know what religious people do. I kind of wished I’d been a Christian with the blind faith that God is doing the right thing. As a Buddhist, you feel like you have more control over the situation, and that you can change your karma.;Marcia Wallace;faith 19538;The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.;Iain Duncan Smith;faith 19539;Men never cling to their dreams with such tenacity as at the moment when they are losing faith in them, and know it, but do not dare yet to confess it to themselves.;William Graham Sumner;faith 19540;Politicians are usually the first to forget that if you assume someone else is acting in bad faith, they will do the same to you.

That’s what this business is all about: trusting in something that may never show up, that you have no concrete proof of.;Wentworth Miller;faith 19543;What unites Oklahomans today is what has always united us: Our unshakable faith. Our love of family and compassion for others. The unlimited promise of a hopeful future.;Brad Henry;faith 19544;Um, I have an enormous faith in God. I have an enormous support system that also has that same belief.;Katey Sagal;faith 19545;I have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines.;Edward Norton;faith 19546;Faith is an island in the setting sun, But proof is the bottom line for everyone.;Paul Simon;faith 19547;It is no longer a question of a Christian going about to convert others to the faith, but of each one being ready to listen to the other and so to grow together in mutual understanding.;Bede Griffiths;faith 19548;I had great faith in Irish actors, that they’d be hip to the whole theatre thing, and they are.

Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life.

I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith 19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up.

You have so many computers, why don't you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not.

We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they're going to do better. That's why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There's nobody I don't say that to.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19491;My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.;Vin Diesel;faith 19492;Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.;Heinrich Heine;faith 19493;Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.;Robert Collier;faith 19494;The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues.

You have so many computers, why don't you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not.

Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life.

You have so many computers, why don't you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not.

That is the Christian faith.;Austin Farrer;faith 19612;I never search for a reason why - I have faith in the Lord's purpose.;Willie Stargell;faith 19613;Since I was an atheist for many years and came to believe in God through my studies in science, it frustrated me to see students and parents who viewed faith and science as enemies.;John Clayton;faith 19614;I'm about as big a star as the Baha'i faith has got, which is pretty pathetic.;Rainn Wilson;faith 19615;There were periods of my life when a lot of people didn't believe in me. I still had faith in myself. I really had to ask myself life questions. Where do I see myself in five years? Create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. Climb that ladder.;Fergie;faith 19616;The best way is to say that as a Christian for me the essence of Christian faith is that you treat others as if you wish to be treated.;Mike Huckabee;faith 19617;All of my children are ideologically and politically in sync with me, they all have authentic Christian faith. It's something I'm very grateful for.;Mike Huckabee;faith 19618;I have very little faith that I'll ever find someone. I've had some bad luck and I've made some bad choices - not in men, but in how I've chosen to deal with relationships.;Selma Blair;faith 19619;In the spiritual body moreover, man appears such as he is with respect to love and faith, for everyone in the spiritual world is the effigy of his own love, not only as to the face and the body, but also as to the speech and the actions.;Emanuel Swedenborg;faith 19620;Faith goes out through the window when beauty comes in at the door.;George Edward Moore;faith 19621;The investigator should have a robust faith - and yet not believe.;Claude Bernard;faith 19622;I am not a great theologian. I know there is a theological concept called invincible ignorance in which a strong enough faith binds you to any facts to the contrary.;Barney Frank;faith 19623;Purity is not imposed upon us as though it were a kind of punishment, it is one of those mysterious but obvious conditions of that supernatural knowledge of ourselves in the Divine, which we speak of as faith.

19452;But I don’t necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday.;Miley Cyrus;faith
19453;What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.;Peter Singer;faith
19454;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;faith
19455;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;faith
19456;Skepticism has never founded empires, established principals, or changed the world’s heart. The great doers in history have always been people of faith.;Edwin Hubbel Chapin;faith
19457;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It’s perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;faith
19458;The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith

19466;Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.;Irving Babbitt;faith
19467;The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.;Irving Babbitt;faith

19471;I don’t need faith.;Maurice Sendak;faith

19474;It’s a new day for the Democrats when it comes to matters of faith, and the younger Evangelicals are aware of this and many of them are moving into the Democratic camp.;Tony Campolo;faith
19475;Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.;Tony Campolo;faith
19476;But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.;Mikhail Bakunin;faith

19479;He who is not impressed by sound advice, lacks faith.;Abu Bakr;faith
19480;That someone like Obama could be elected president of the United States - with its unrivaled power and prestige - has begun to restore the country’s and the world’s faith in America as the land of opportunity.;Dee Dee Myers;faith

19482;I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don’t know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.;Ryan Gosling;faith
19483;Resist your fear fear will never lead to you a positive end. Go for your faith and what you believe.;T. D. Jakes;faith
19484;Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.;J. C. Watts;faith
19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;faith

19489;Over the years my mother’s steadfast faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.;Benjamin Carson;faith
19490;The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they’re going to do better. That’s why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There’s nobody I don’t say that to.;Benjamin Carson;faith
19491;My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.;Vin Diesel;faith
19492;Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.;Heinrich Heine;faith
19493;Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.;Robert Collier;faith
19494;The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it’s a faith issue, it’s a religious issue.;Jim Wallis;faith
19495;Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;faith
19496;It’s possible that the 2012 general-election race will be the least overtly religious one since 1972, the last campaign before Roe v. Wade and the rise of Jimmy Carter brought evangelicalism into the political mainstream. That’s because faith remains a complicated issue for Obama, who is still wrongly thought to be a Muslim in some quarters.;Jon Meacham;faith
19497;While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith, our politics and our culture are, in the main, less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago. I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith
19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up. I am also a critic of Christianity, if by critic one means an observer who brings historical and literary judgment to bear on the texts and traditions of the church.;Jon Meacham;faith

19502;You know, this idea of going around the world imposing democracy by growing a middle-class, a trading merchant class that is independent of your faith, is a good notion, but we’re all partially different - it’s no good imposing systems on people that it doesn’t suit.;Damian Lewis;faith

19513;For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.;Giacomo Casanova;faith
19514;You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don’t you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith
19515;I’m a scientist, not a theologian. I don’t know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.;James Lovelock;faith
19516;Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.;Sean Connery;faith
19517;There are so many people that don’t believe in themselves and don’t have faith.;Lenny Kravitz;faith
19518;All an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today, in any scene.;Meryl Streep;faith
19519;From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.;Eliot Spitzer;faith
19520;As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.;Eliot Spitzer;faith
19521;Everything I am I owe to my faith and secondly to parents who were old school.;J. C. Watts;faith

19525;If you desire faith, then you have faith enough.;Elizabeth Barrett Browning;faith

19530;Jews survived all the defeats, expulsions, persecutions and pogroms, the centuries in which they were regarded as a pariah people, even the Holocaust itself, because they never gave up the faith that one day they would be free to live as Jews without fear.;Jonathan Sacks;faith
19531;The royals - all of them, especially Prince Philip and Prince Charles - have done outstanding work with the faith communities.;Jonathan Sacks;faith

19534;An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments. Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted.;Donald Cram;faith
19535;Until as recently as November of 1966, I had complete faith in the Warren Report. Of course, my faith in the Report was grounded in ignorance, since I had never read it.;Jim Garrison;faith
19536;Ever since the Crusades, when Christians from western Europe were fighting holy wars against Muslims in the near east, western people have often perceived Islam as a violent and intolerant faith - even though when this prejudice took root Islam had a better record of tolerance than Christianity.;Karen Armstrong;faith
19537;I don’t know what religious people do. I kind of wished I’d been a Christian with the blind faith that God is doing the right thing. As a Buddhist, you feel like you have more control over the situation, and that you can change your karma.;Marcia Wallace;faith
19538;The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.;Iain Duncan Smith;faith

19540;Politicians are usually the first to forget that if you assume someone else is acting in bad faith, they will do the same to you. Questioning motives poisons the well.;John Sununu;faith

19542;There has to be a measure of faith. That’s what this business is all about: trusting in something that may never show up, that you have no concrete proof of.;Wentworth Miller;faith
19543;What unites Oklahomans today is what has always united us: Our unshakable faith. Our love of family and compassion for others. The unlimited promise of a hopeful future.;Brad Henry;faith
19544;Um, I have an enormous faith in God. I have an enormous support system that also has that same belief.;Katey Sagal;faith
19545;I have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines.;Edward Norton;faith
19546;Faith is an island in the setting sun, But proof is the bottom line for everyone.;Paul Simon;faith

19555;I think that films about faith made for faith-based communities have a certain tactic.;Vera Farmiga;faith
19556;It’s a very different thing, religion and faith. Religion is man-made, it’s man-regulated. And faith, you can define God as you wish. But I think they’re two different things.;Vera Farmiga;faith
19557;Honestly, I think a good film is spiritual, regardless of whether its subject is faith.;Vera Farmiga;faith
19558;We got on his label, and the Bizarre organization is just going up and up. So we have faith.;Alice Cooper;faith
19559;If you have abandoned one faith, do not abandon all faith. There is always an alternative to the faith we lose. Or is it the same faith under another mask?;Graham Greene;faith
19560;I am shy to admit that I have followed the advice given all those years ago by a wise archbishop to a bewildered young man: that moments of unbelief ‘don’t matter,’ that if you return to a practice of the faith, faith will return.;A. N. Wilson;faith
19561;I have a disproportionate amount of faith in the goodness of the world and that everything will actually work out okay.;Sloane Crosley;faith

19571;Our country’s political discourse and debate are enriched by discussions of the political implications of our faith traditions, whether they are taking place in our communities, at our dinner tables, or in our places of worship.;David E. Price;faith
19572;The most that one of Jewish faith can do - and some have gladly done it - is to say that Jesus was the greatest in the long succession of Jewish prophets. None can acknowledge that Jesus was the Messiah without becoming a Christian.;Kenneth Scott Latourette;faith
19573;There’s a loss of faith in the banking system that for so long has been the backbone of prosperity and growth.;Lucy Powell;faith
19574;In properly organized groups no faith is required what is required is simply a little trust and even that only for a little while, for the sooner a man begins to verify all he hears the better it is for him.;G. I. Gurdjieff;faith
19575;Faith, sir, we are here today, and gone tomorrow.;Aphra Behn;faith
19576;Earmarks have become a symbol of a Congress that has broken faith with the people. This earmark ban shows the American people we are listening and we are dead serious about ending business as usual in Washington.;John Boehner;faith
19577;I think basically becoming famous has taken the place of going to Heaven in modern society, hasn’t it? That’s the place where your dreams will come true. It’s an act of faith now they think that’s going to sort things out.;Jarvis Cocker;faith
19578;Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith, one must first force one’s mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.;Karen Armstrong;faith
19579;The hajj is one of the five essential practices of Islam when they make the pilgrimage to Mecca, Muslims ritually act out the central principles of their faith.;Karen Armstrong;faith
19580;Well, I’ve never left my faith - but have I made a lot of mistakes? But was I fortunate that I was brought up in that Pentecostal church, where I heard about God’s love and God’s forgiveness.;Billy Ray Cyrus;faith
19581;It’s a leap of faith doing any serialised storytelling.;J. J. Abrams;faith
19582;I find that it’s hard to fully examine one’s life and not have faith be part of the discussion.;J. J. Abrams;faith
19583;Comedy is an escape, not from truth but from despair a narrow escape into faith.;Christopher Fry;faith
19584;We are stronger because we recognize that government isn’t the sole answer to the most important questions, and we welcome community and faith based organizations as partners to serve the needs of Florida families.;Jeb Bush;faith
19585;People with deep faith and big hearts are concerned, as I am about the circumstance that Ms. Schiavo is in. I want them to know I will do what I can, but there are limits to what any particular person - irrespective of the title they currently hold - can do.;Jeb Bush;faith
19586;My faith is the grand drama of my life. I’m a believer, so I sing words of God to those who have no faith.;Olivier Messiaen;faith
19587;It is amazing to think after all that has happened in this country in the last few years, the last few decades, that so many people have this blind faith that government is our friend and therefore, so we don’t need protections against it.;James Bovard;faith
19588;Faith is not a sense, nor sight, nor reason, but taking God at His work.;Faith Evans;faith
19589;That is not to say that we can relax our readiness to defend ourselves. Our armament must be adequate to the needs, but our faith is not primarily in these machines of defense but in ourselves.;Chester W. Nimitz;faith
19590;I think the Hispanic community, the values that resonate in our community, are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family, patriotism.;Ted Cruz;faith
19591;Thank goodness I had a great family growing up, a great foundation. But I will say my faith, my parents, my family, all that stuff is very, very important. And I’ll say that until the day I die.;Donny Osmond;faith

19593;Competition got me off the farm and trained me to seek out challenges and to endure setbacks and in combination with my faith, it sustains me now in my fight with Alzheimer’s disease.;Pat Summitt;faith
19594;I still have a belief and a faith that some great things are still going to happen in my career. If I didn’t believe that, it makes no sense for me to be out there, and on top of that, I know this is a period of time that God wants me to persevere through.;Michael Chang;faith
19595;My faith experience, well, as you can imagine, you need a lot of faith to raise five boys.;Ann Romney;faith
19596;That is the definition of faith - acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove.;Dan Brown;faith
