<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>Hamlet’ is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper. All the big, unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death what’s real and not real. All these subjects can literally drive you mad.;Michael Sheen;death 14070;If we openly declare what is wrong with us, what is our deepest need, then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear.;J. B. Priestley;death 14071;The most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination.;George Meredith;death 14072;To be immortal is commonplace except for man, all creatures are immortal, for they are ignorant of death what is divine, terrible, incomprehensible, is to know that one is immortal.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14073;Life and death have been lacking in my life.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14074;Ultimately life is disease, death and oblivion. It’s still better than high school.;Dan Savage;death 14075;My children are magical creatures and I love them to death.;Jack Black;death 14076;But then I’m one of those guys that is still a bit afraid of the telephone, its implications for conversation. I still wonder if the jukebox might be the death of live music.;Tom Waits;death 14077;Perhaps we don’t need these religious concoctions to pillow the fear of death. Just the fact that there is an unknown, and something greater, can bring a feeling of peace. That’s enough for me.;Brad Pitt;death 14078;If a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club, they’d starve to death.;Sam Snead;death 14079;In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can’t even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn’t have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;death 14080;Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.;Michael Collins;death 14081;I don’t think I would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties. There’s always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent.;Jesse Ventura;death 14082;I hit rock bottom, but thank God my bottom wasn’t death.;Stevie Ray Vaughan;death 14083;In an artwork you’re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.;Damien Hirst;death 14084;Since I was a child, death is definitely something that I think about every day. But I think that everybody does. You try and avoid it, but it’s such a big thing that you can’t.;Damien Hirst;death 14085;The difference between art about death and actual death is that one’s a celebration and the other’s a dull fact.;Damien Hirst;death 14086;I was taught to confront things you can’t avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you’re trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy. The fact that flowers don’t last for ever makes them beautiful.;Damien Hirst;death 14087;I wouldn’t feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I’d be bored to death.;Joaquin Phoenix;death 14088;It’s not life or death it’s a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser.;Bernhard Langer;death 14089;Miller didn’t write Death of a Salesman. He released it. It was there inside him, waiting to be turned loose. That’s the measure of its merit.;Elia Kazan;death 14090;Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.;Georg Hermes;death 14091;I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn’t. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;death 14092;I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world. There is a death wish, a perverse death wish. Not just for ourselves, not just for the movie ‘Death Wish,’ but for the end of all human life.;John Hodgman;death 14093;When you think about it, the end of the world is a little bit like death: We all know it’s going to come eventually, and as we get older, we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly.;John Hodgman;death 14094;I try to write lyrics so that they won’t age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.;Florence Welch;death 14095;A friend said to me, ‘Be glad for your troubles - they strengthen you.’ Well, if that’s the truth, I’m going to be so strong they’ll have to beat me to death!;Sonia Johnson;death 14096;She goes through the vale of death alone, each time a babe is born. As it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal, so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it.;Margaret Sanger;death 14097;Emigration is no longer a solution it’s a defeat. People are risking death, drowning every day, but they’re knocking on doors that are not open.;Tahar Ben Jelloun;death 14098;In Goddess religion death is not feared, but is understood to be a part of life, followed by birth and renewal.;Carol P. Christ;death 14099;Death’s an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.;Ivan Turgenev;death 14100;Feminists bore me to death. I follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way, great. But I’d rather they saw it more as a lesson about following their own instincts rather than imitating somebody.;Bjork;death 14101;No real English gentleman, in his secret soul, was ever sorry for the death of a political economist.;Walter Bagehot;death 14102;There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death 14103;Vets do what doctors used to - diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death.;Jane Smiley;death 14104;Somehow, knowing that Alzheimer’s is coming mocks all one’s aspirations - to tell stories, to think through certain issues as only a novel can do, to be recognised for one’s accomplishments and hard work - in a way that old familiar death does not.;Jane Smiley;death 14105;We should weep for men at their birth, not at their death.;Charles de Montesquieu;death 14106;You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.;Ian Fleming;death 14107;I think when you’re 10 years old, it’s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode. Kids are better left naive about certain things.;J. J. Abrams;death 14108;I love myself. Anything that has my name I’m tickled to death.;Barbara Corcoran;death 14109;Sin brought death, and death will disappear with the disappearance of sin.;Mary Baker Eddy;death 14110;There is nothing glamorous about death.;Roger Moore;death 14111;My book ‘Trust Your Heart’, which is the story of my life, will be followed by ‘Singing Lessons’, a memoir of love, loss, hope, and healing, which talks about the death of my son and the hope that has been the aftermath of the healing from that tragedy.;Judy Collins;death 14112;Defeat the fear of death and welcome the death of fear.;G. Gordon Liddy;death 14113;The coward sneaks to death the brave live on.;George Sewell;death 14114;Only those who spread treachery, fire, and death out of hatred for the prosperity of others are undeserving of pity.;Jose Marti;death 14115;If the heart stops for more than two minutes, you have massive brain death. There are only two minutes between our conscious world and zero. That’s how fragile our consciousness is.;Robin Gibb;death 14116;The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!;Heather Mills;death 14117;I believe in the institution of marriage. Of course being a Mormon, we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part. If you really try hard, if you make it work, it’s blissful. But I also know a marriage that isn’t working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn’t have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother’s death. The renewed energy, the surprising sweetness of grief. The tenderness I feel for strangers on walkers. The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.;Mary Schmich;death 14119;You haven’t lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.;Vance Havner;death 14120;I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.;Nancy Reagan;death 14121;As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring.;Hulk Hogan;death 14122;I have had death threats from people with fixations.;Enya;death 14123;Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.;Hilaire Belloc;death 14124;People who are sick, or who have been sick, or have come close to death have a lot to say - and they want you to hear it.;Anna Deavere Smith;death 14125;Living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life. It helps you to live a less trivial life.;Sogyal Rinpoche;death 14126;The line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do.;Bear Grylls;death 14127;Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It’s up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death 14128;My faith isn’t very churchy, it’s a pretty personal, intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death.;Bear Grylls;death 14129;More than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they weren’t guilty or fairly tried. Most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them. There is a lot that is wrong.;John Grisham;death 14130;Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it’s bound to get in the way. But, no, it doesn’t scare me at all.;David Carradine;death 14131;We weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven.;Tryon Edwards;death 14132;Everything that is necessary is also easy. You just have to accept it. And the most necessary, the most natural matter on this planet is death.;Friedrich Durrenmatt;death 14133;I was ready to quit music. It felt to me like music equalled death.;Dave Grohl;death 14134;Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.;Eugene Ionesco;death 14135;I really wanted to do something positive on the Internet. I wanted to try to get young people talking about, thinking about, life’s big questions-make it cool and OK to wonder about the heart, the soul and free will and God and death and big topics like that, big human topics.;Rainn Wilson;death 14136;I think that the core doctrines of Christianity - the incarnation, the resurrection, life after death-these are as strong as ever. In fact, the belief in life after death has increased in this century.;Andrew Greeley;death 14137;Of all the artists on Death Row, none of them went bankrupt.;Suge Knight;death 14138;For any culture which is primarily concerned with meaning, the study of death - the only certainty that life holds for us - must be central, for an understanding of death is the key to liberation in life.;Stanislav Grof;death 14139;The study of consciousness that can extend beyond the body is extremely important for the issue of survival, since it is this part of human personality that would be likely to survive death.;Stanislav Grof;death 14140;The motif of death plays an important role the human psyche in connection with archetypal and karmic material.;Stanislav Grof;death 14141;The materialistic paradigm of Western science has been a major obstacle for any objective evaluation of the data describing the events occurring at the time of death.;Stanislav Grof;death 14142;The knowledge of the realm of death makes it possible for the shaman to move freely back and forth and mediate these journeys for other people.;Stanislav Grof;death 14143;The experiences associated with death were seen as visits to important dimensions of reality that deserved to be experienced, studied, and carefully mapped.;Stanislav Grof;death 14144;The elimination of the fear of death transforms the individual’s way of being in the world.;Stanislav Grof;death 14145;Research challenges the materialistic understanding of death, according to which biological death represents the final end of existence and of all conscious activity.;Stanislav Grof;death 14146;Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives, who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.;Stanislav Grof;death 14147;If consciousness can function independently of the body during one’s lifetime, it could be able to do the same after death.;Stanislav Grof;death 14148;Dying before dying has two important consequences: It liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise.;Stanislav Grof;death 14149;A number of cases have been reported in which a dying individual has a vision of a person about whose death he or she did not know.;Stanislav Grof;death 14150;The drink?

I have a stuffed two headed sheep!;Kirk Hammett;death 14153;Since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion.;Al Goldstein;death 14154;Of course, we avoid death.

He electrified an entire world!;Rita Dove;death 14158;When I see someone who is starved, they don’t look alert. They don’t have boundless energy. If you’re too skinny, it looks like you’re near death.;Kirstie Alley;death 14159;’American Horror’ goes for a very specific kind of Seventies suburban downer ambience - ‘Flowers in the Attic’ paperbacks, Black Sabbath album covers and late-night flicks like ‘Let’s Scare Jessica to Death.’ It even has ‘Go Ask Alice’-era urban legends.;Rob Sheffield;death 14160;People want the right to die at a time of their own choosing.

I want them to witness me overcome it.;Travis Barker;death 14164;Death by starvation is slow.;Mary Austin;death 14165;Libertarians know that a free country has nothing to fear from anyone coming in or going out - while a welfare state is scared to death of poor people coming in and rich people getting out.;Harry Browne;death 14166;Women have not yet realized the cowardice that resides, for if they should decide to do so, they would be able to fight you until death and to prove that I speak the truth, amongst so many women, I will be the first to act, setting an example for them to follow.;Veronica Franco;death 14167;Sickness, insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my cradle and they have followed me throughout my life.;Edvard Munch;death 14168;There are people who never experience that, who remain closed until death, from fear of change.;Isabelle Adjani;death 14169;One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won’t jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death.

Globally, the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fifty-fold over the past century.;Bjorn Lomborg;death 14191;I am politically pro-choice, but personally pro-life.

Wilson;death 14196;Over the past 50 years we got versions of X-ray specs and space vacations, and even death rays.

As a comic, you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death.;Alexei Sayle;death 14219;The writer crafts their ideal world. In my world, everyone has really long conversations or just picks apart pop culture to death and everyone talks in monologue.;Kevin Smith;death 14220;Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.;Yasser Arafat;death 14221;If I ever completely lost my nervousness I would be frightened half to death.;Paul Lynde;death 14222;I think I might actually die of showing off.

I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;death 14092;I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world.

Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death 14103;Vets do what doctors used to - diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death.;Jane Smiley;death 14104;Somehow, knowing that Alzheimer’s is coming mocks all one’s aspirations - to tell stories, to think through certain issues as only a novel can do, to be recognised for one’s accomplishments and hard work - in a way that old familiar death does not.;Jane Smiley;death 14105;We should weep for men at their birth, not at their death.;Charles de Montesquieu;death 14106;You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.;Ian Fleming;death 14107;I think when you’re 10 years old, it’s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode.

That’s how fragile our consciousness is.;Robin Gibb;death 14116;The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!;Heather Mills;death 14117;I believe in the institution of marriage. Of course being a Mormon, we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part. If you really try hard, if you make it work, it’s blissful. But I also know a marriage that isn’t working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn’t have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother’s death. The renewed energy, the surprising sweetness of grief. The tenderness I feel for strangers on walkers. The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.;Mary Schmich;death 14119;You haven’t lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.;Vance Havner;death 14120;I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.;Nancy Reagan;death 14121;As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring.;Hulk Hogan;death 14122;I have had death threats from people with fixations.;Enya;death 14123;Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.;Hilaire Belloc;death 14124;People who are sick, or who have been sick, or have come close to death have a lot to say - and they want you to hear it.;Anna Deavere Smith;death 14125;Living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life. It helps you to live a less trivial life.;Sogyal Rinpoche;death 14126;The line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do.;Bear Grylls;death 14127;Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It’s up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death 14128;My faith isn’t very churchy, it’s a pretty personal, intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death.;Bear Grylls;death 14129;More than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they weren’t guilty or fairly tried. Most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them. There is a lot that is wrong.;John Grisham;death 14130;Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it’s bound to get in the way.

A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.;Eugene Ionesco;death 14135;I really wanted to do something positive on the Internet. I wanted to try to get young people talking about, thinking about, life’s big questions-make it cool and OK to wonder about the heart, the soul and free will and God and death and big topics like that, big human topics.;Rainn Wilson;death 14136;I think that the core doctrines of Christianity - the incarnation, the resurrection, life after death-these are as strong as ever.

If you’re too skinny, it looks like you’re near death.;Kirstie Alley;death 14159;’American Horror’ goes for a very specific kind of Seventies suburban downer ambience - ‘Flowers in the Attic’ paperbacks, Black Sabbath album covers and late-night flicks like ‘Let’s Scare Jessica to Death.’ It even has ‘Go Ask Alice’-era urban legends.;Rob Sheffield;death 14160;People want the right to die at a time of their own choosing.

Globally, the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fifty-fold over the past century.;Bjorn Lomborg;death 14191;I am politically pro-choice, but personally pro-life.

Wilson;death 14196;Over the past 50 years we got versions of X-ray specs and space vacations, and even death rays.

As a comic, you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death.;Alexei Sayle;death 14219;The writer crafts their ideal world. In my world, everyone has really long conversations or just picks apart pop culture to death and everyone talks in monologue.;Kevin Smith;death 14220;Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.;Yasser Arafat;death 14221;If I ever completely lost my nervousness I would be frightened half to death.;Paul Lynde;death 14222;I think I might actually die of showing off.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Hamlet’ is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper. All the big, unknowable questions like what it is to be a human being the difference between sanity and insanity the meaning of life and death what’s real and not real. All these subjects can literally drive you mad.;Michael Sheen;death 14070;If we openly declare what is wrong with us, what is our deepest need, then perhaps the death and despair will by degrees disappear.;J. B. Priestley;death 14071;The most dire disaster in love is the death of imagination.;George Meredith;death 14072;To be immortal is commonplace except for man, all creatures are immortal, for they are ignorant of death what is divine, terrible, incomprehensible, is to know that one is immortal.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14073;Life and death have been lacking in my life.;Jorge Luis Borges;death 14074;Ultimately life is disease, death and oblivion. It’s still better than high school.;Dan Savage;death 14075;My children are magical creatures and I love them to death.;Jack Black;death 14076;But then I’m one of those guys that is still a bit afraid of the telephone, its implications for conversation. I still wonder if the jukebox might be the death of live music.;Tom Waits;death 14077;Perhaps we don’t need these religious concoctions to pillow the fear of death. Just the fact that there is an unknown, and something greater, can bring a feeling of peace. That’s enough for me.;Brad Pitt;death 14078;If a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club, they’d starve to death.;Sam Snead;death 14079;In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can’t even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder. The name doesn’t have a particular history. His Infernal Majesty was a totally different band. I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;death 14080;Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.;Michael Collins;death 14081;I don’t think I would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties. There’s always the inevitable question of whether someone you gave the order to execute might truly have been innocent.;Jesse Ventura;death 14082;I hit rock bottom, but thank God my bottom wasn’t death.;Stevie Ray Vaughan;death 14083;In an artwork you’re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.;Damien Hirst;death 14084;Since I was a child, death is definitely something that I think about every day. But I think that everybody does. You try and avoid it, but it’s such a big thing that you can’t.;Damien Hirst;death 14085;The difference between art about death and actual death is that one’s a celebration and the other’s a dull fact.;Damien Hirst;death 14086;I was taught to confront things you can’t avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you’re trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy. The fact that flowers don’t last for ever makes them beautiful.;Damien Hirst;death 14087;I wouldn’t feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I’d be bored to death.;Joaquin Phoenix;death 14088;It’s not life or death it’s a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser.;Bernhard Langer;death 14089;Miller didn’t write Death of a Salesman.

That’s the measure of its merit.;Elia Kazan;death 14090;Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.;Georg Hermes;death 14091;I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed.

I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;death 14092;I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world.

Not just for ourselves, not just for the movie ‘Death Wish,’ but for the end of all human life.;John Hodgman;death 14093;When you think about it, the end of the world is a little bit like death: We all know it’s going to come eventually, and as we get older, we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly.;John Hodgman;death 14094;I try to write lyrics so that they won’t age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.;Florence Welch;death 14095;A friend said to me, ‘Be glad for your troubles - they strengthen you.’ Well, if that’s the truth, I’m going to be so strong they’ll have to beat me to death!;Sonia Johnson;death 14096;She goes through the vale of death alone, each time a babe is born. As it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal, so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it.;Margaret Sanger;death 14097;Emigration is no longer a solution it’s a defeat. People are risking death, drowning every day, but they’re knocking on doors that are not open.;Tahar Ben Jelloun;death 14098;In Goddess religion death is not feared, but is understood to be a part of life, followed by birth and renewal.;Carol P. Christ;death 14099;Death’s an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.;Ivan Turgenev;death 14100;Feminists bore me to death. I follow my instinct and if that supports young girls in any way, great.

Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death 14103;Vets do what doctors used to - diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death.;Jane Smiley;death 14104;Somehow, knowing that Alzheimer’s is coming mocks all one’s aspirations - to tell stories, to think through certain issues as only a novel can do, to be recognised for one’s accomplishments and hard work - in a way that old familiar death does not.;Jane Smiley;death 14105;We should weep for men at their birth, not at their death.;Charles de Montesquieu;death 14106;You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.;Ian Fleming;death 14107;I think when you’re 10 years old, it’s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode.

That’s how fragile our consciousness is.;Robin Gibb;death 14116;The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!;Heather Mills;death 14117;I believe in the institution of marriage. Of course being a Mormon, we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part. If you really try hard, if you make it work, it’s blissful. But I also know a marriage that isn’t working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn’t have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother’s death. The renewed energy, the surprising sweetness of grief. The tenderness I feel for strangers on walkers. The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.;Mary Schmich;death 14119;You haven’t lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.;Vance Havner;death 14120;I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.;Nancy Reagan;death 14121;As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring.;Hulk Hogan;death 14122;I have had death threats from people with fixations.;Enya;death 14123;Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.;Hilaire Belloc;death 14124;People who are sick, or who have been sick, or have come close to death have a lot to say - and they want you to hear it.;Anna Deavere Smith;death 14125;Living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life. It helps you to live a less trivial life.;Sogyal Rinpoche;death 14126;The line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do.;Bear Grylls;death 14127;Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It’s up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death 14128;My faith isn’t very churchy, it’s a pretty personal, intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death.;Bear Grylls;death 14129;More than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they weren’t guilty or fairly tried. Most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them. There is a lot that is wrong.;John Grisham;death 14130;Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it’s bound to get in the way. But, no, it doesn’t scare me at all.;David Carradine;death 14131;We weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven.;Tryon Edwards;death 14132;Everything that is necessary is also easy.

It felt to me like music equalled death.;Dave Grohl;death 14134;Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.;Eugene Ionesco;death 14135;I really wanted to do something positive on the Internet.

These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.;Stanislav Grof;death 14147;If consciousness can function independently of the body during one’s lifetime, it could be able to do the same after death.;Stanislav Grof;death 14148;Dying before dying has two important consequences: It liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise.;Stanislav Grof;death 14149;A number of cases have been reported in which a dying individual has a vision of a person about whose death he or she did not know.;Stanislav Grof;death 14150;The drink?

If you’re too skinny, it looks like you’re near death.;Kirstie Alley;death 14159;’American Horror’ goes for a very specific kind of Seventies suburban downer ambience - ‘Flowers in the Attic’ paperbacks, Black Sabbath album covers and late-night flicks like ‘Let’s Scare Jessica to Death.’ It even has ‘Go Ask Alice’-era urban legends.;Rob Sheffield;death 14160;People want the right to die at a time of their own choosing.

I think HIM derives from some death metal joke.;Ville Valo;death 14080;Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.;Michael Collins;death 14081;I don’t think I would want the responsibility for enforcing the death penalties.

I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;death 14092;I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world.

As it is the right neither of man nor the state to coerce her into this ordeal, so it is her right to decide whether she will endure it.;Margaret Sanger;death 14097;Emigration is no longer a solution it’s a defeat.

Christ;death 14099;Death’s an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.;Ivan Turgenev;death 14100;Feminists bore me to death.

Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death 14103;Vets do what doctors used to - diagnose the injury or the condition, patch it up as best they can and remind you that these things happen and that in life we are also in the midst of death.;Jane Smiley;death 14104;Somehow, knowing that Alzheimer’s is coming mocks all one’s aspirations - to tell stories, to think through certain issues as only a novel can do, to be recognised for one’s accomplishments and hard work - in a way that old familiar death does not.;Jane Smiley;death 14105;We should weep for men at their birth, not at their death.;Charles de Montesquieu;death 14106;You only live twice. Once when you are born and once when you look death in the face.;Ian Fleming;death 14107;I think when you’re 10 years old, it’s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode.

That’s how fragile our consciousness is.;Robin Gibb;death 14116;The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!;Heather Mills;death 14117;I believe in the institution of marriage. Of course being a Mormon, we believe in eternity rather than just till death do us part. If you really try hard, if you make it work, it’s blissful. But I also know a marriage that isn’t working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn’t have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother’s death. The renewed energy, the surprising sweetness of grief. The tenderness I feel for strangers on walkers. The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.;Mary Schmich;death 14119;You haven’t lost anything when you know were it is. Death can hide but not divide.;Vance Havner;death 14120;I think people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.;Nancy Reagan;death 14121;As far as my divorce goes, I love my family and I love my wife to death and I just don’t know what tomorrow’s going to bring.;Hulk Hogan;death 14122;I have had death threats from people with fixations.;Enya;death 14123;Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.;Hilaire Belloc;death 14124;People who are sick, or who have been sick, or have come close to death have a lot to say - and they want you to hear it.;Anna Deavere Smith;death 14125;Living with the immediacy of death helps you sort out your priorities in life. It helps you to live a less trivial life.;Sogyal Rinpoche;death 14126;The line between life or death is determined by what we are willing to do.;Bear Grylls;death 14127;Bulls can do nothing to demand justice. They can only defend themselves as best they can in a fight with a pre-determined ending and die never knowing why they were forced to endure such a painful and prolonged death. It’s up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death 14128;My faith isn’t very churchy, it’s a pretty personal, intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death.;Bear Grylls;death 14129;More than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they weren’t guilty or fairly tried. Most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them. There is a lot that is wrong.;John Grisham;death 14130;Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it’s bound to get in the way.

A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.;Eugene Ionesco;death 14135;I really wanted to do something positive on the Internet.

Wilson;death 14196;Over the past 50 years we got versions of X-ray specs and space vacations, and even death rays.

But I also know a marriage that isn't working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn't have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother's death.

But I also know a marriage that isn't working can be painful.;Donny Osmond;death 14118;I couldn't have foreseen all the good things that have followed my mother's death.

It's up to us, as a civilized society, to call for an end to the Running of the Bulls and bullfighting.;Ingrid Newkirk;death 14128;My faith isn't very churchy, it's a pretty personal, intimate thing and has been a huge source of strength in moments of life and death.;Bear Grylls;death 14129;More than 100 people have been sent to death row who were later exonerated because they weren't guilty or fairly tried. Most criminal defendants do not get adequate representation because there are not enough public defenders to represent them. There is a lot that is wrong.;John Grisham;death 14130;Why would you be afraid of death? It would be an inconvenience. I have a lot of undone things and it's bound to get in the way.

Globally, the death rate from catastrophes has dropped about fifty-fold over the past century.;Bjorn Lomborg;death 14191;I am politically pro-choice, but personally pro-life.

Wilson;death 14196;Over the past 50 years we got versions of X-ray specs and space vacations, and even death rays.

14079;In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can’t even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder.

14085;The difference between art about death and actual death is that one’s a celebration and the other’s a dull fact.;Damien Hirst;death
14086;I was taught to confront things you can’t avoid. Death is one of those things.

14217;As a comic, you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death.;Alexei Sayle;death
14218;I’ve accentuated the look over the years. As a comic, you try something and if it works you go with it and grind it to death.;Alexei Sayle;death
