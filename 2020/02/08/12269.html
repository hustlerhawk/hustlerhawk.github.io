I relate to that, and I’ve been known to crawl out of bed and drink out of a 2-liter bottle of Diet Coke.;Diablo Cody;diet 14811;Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there’s a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt.

You just have to do it the natural way - diet and exercise and stick to it - and be able to do it at your own pace.;Jordin Sparks;diet 14829;I am fussy, about my diet and straining my voice. I know, sounds a bit over the top. But I’m not as bad as I used to be. These days I don’t drink alcohol for five days before a show - very dehydrating for the vocal cords, and all that acid reflux. I used to ban it for a fortnight. Nightmare.;Katherine Jenkins;diet 14830;I do follow a version of the Dukan diet, but I don’t follow it to the extreme so a lot of fish and vegetables. If I want chocolate I’ll let myself have a bit of chocolate in moderation.;Katherine Jenkins;diet 14831;Right now I’d love to be sitting on a Greek island somewhere because of being Greek American, eating great octopus salad and some fantastic lamb. Or sipping a little ouzo. I think the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest… Lots of nuts, vegetables, fruits, fresh fish, lean meats, yogurt.;Cat Cora;diet 14832;I always had to diet.

It’s a little magic powder based on Dr. Hirsh’s clinical trials and studies and it basically signals the brain that you’re full through smellology.;Patti Stanger;diet 14845;But I don’t do the diet thing anymore.

We eat a lot of dark leafy greens, and a couple meals each week are meat-free. We enjoy eating a balanced diet.;Rachael Ray;diet 14852;I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America.

I’ve never had to go on a diet and that’s because of Weight Watchers.;Ginnifer Goodwin;diet 14856;I’ve drunk Amazon’s free Diet Coke.

Good food choices are good investments.;Bethenny Frankel;diet 14864;My diet is mostly chicken and fish. I make sure I get a lot of vegetables, a lot of fruit.

The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.;Gael Garcia Bernal;diet 14882;I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet. I think in the grand history of story-telling, going back to people sitting around fires, the dark side of human nature has always been very important. Movies are part of that tradition.;Eric Stoltz;diet 14883;I’m an emotional eater. When I get upset, my diet goes out the window.;Kelly Osbourne;diet 14884;I like starting off the new year fresh.

It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that’s all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet 14888;Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat.

High blood pressure is from all this high-fat eating.;Jack LaLanne;diet 14889;I won’t sit here and say I’ve never had a pimple, but I try to have a really great diet, you know, lots of vegetables and fish.
