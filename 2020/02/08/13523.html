<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>Friends’ was an education in intelligent comedic banter in intelligent vernacular. It was an education in scene study. It was an education in group dynamic. I came out of there with a master’s degree in comedy.;Matt LeBlanc;education 16506;About half my work in education is U.S. political reform around school districts and charter schools, and creating more room for entrepreneurial organizations to develop. And about half on technology, which I look at as a global platform.;Reed Hastings;education 16507;What’s got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education 16508;Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want. In other words, there’s an education level that plays into the mix and so if it’s inexpensive to buy an hour of real good education in places like China versus the U.S., that factors in.;Ray Dalio;education 16509;I was really fortunate growing up to have a broad musical education. My parents listened to all kinds of music, rock, soul, Motown, jazz, Frank Sinatra, everything.;Mayer Hawthorne;education 16510;A liberal education… frees a man from the prison-house of his class, race, time, place, background, family and even his nation.;Robert M. Hutchins;education 16511;Many thousands of youth have been deprived of the benefit of education thereby, their morals ruined, and talents irretrievably lost to society, for want of cultivation: while two parties have been idly contending who should bestow it.;Joseph Lancaster;education 16512;When I enrolled in college at age 19, I had a total of eight years of formal classroom education. As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education 16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education 16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;education 16515;Further Education should be about the ability to learn, not the ability to pay - everyone who is able should have the opportunity, regardless of their family background. I don’t want to see students struggling with huge debts or frightened off even going to university in the first place.;Charles Kennedy;education 16516;But I like going to church. If you’ve been brought up in the Church of England, it feels like visiting an elderly relative. And I think it’s important that part of the kids’ education is knowing about the Bible.;Jack Dee;education 16517;A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.;Agnes de Mille;education 16518;In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you’re a theater actor it’s very difficult to make a living. But it’s also a very beautiful pathway to knowledge and to an open education.;Gael Garcia Bernal;education 16519;I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have.;George J. Mitchell;education 16520;I don’t want to scrounge around and be homeless, and I want to finish my education.;Callan McAuliffe;education 16521;It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current. So you do have to stay current to maintain your license even if you are not practicing.;Frank Shorter;education 16522;Education makes us more stupid than the brutes. A thousand voices call to us on every hand, but our ears are stopped with wisdom.;Jean Giraudoux;education 16523;At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.;William John Wills;education 16524;Making the City Of Joy gave me the best political education of my life. It became a wrestling match between an Englishman who had gradually ceased to be a Marxist, and a culture that was becoming more Marxist by the day.;Roland Joffe;education 16525;In my home State of Louisiana, several institutions of higher education have been impacted by both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, literally dozens across the entire State.;Bobby Jindal;education 16526;Poorer students take out larger loans and will have to contribute more to the cost of higher education.;Anne Campbell;education 16527;There is still a lot of misinformation being spread about higher education funding arrangements under the new Act. The students page on my website sets out the main points in the Act.;Anne Campbell;education 16528;Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can’t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.;Bjorn Lomborg;education 16529;And really, the basis, I think, of achieving some success in what I want to do today comes from my mother’s push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education.;Sam Donaldson;education 16530;The amount of money we spend on education is important, but not nearly as important as how the money is spent.;Bob Riley;education 16531;Ladies and gentlemen: There can be no greater investment in Alabama’s future than an investment in education.;Bob Riley;education 16532;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;education 16533;The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education. They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave.;Rick Santorum;education 16534;I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.;Kamala Harris;education 16535;Each year, I say I’m going to go to school next year. It’s inevitable that I’ll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education 16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country. It is an open door for drugs, criminals, and potential terrorists to enter our country. It is straining our economy, adding costs to our judicial, healthcare, and education systems.;Timothy Murphy;education 16537;For this reason, to study English literature without some general knowledge of the relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave one’s literary education very incomplete.;Lafcadio Hearn;education 16538;The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.;Liberty Hyde Bailey;education 16539;There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.;Marvin Hamlisch;education 16540;Interactions between fathers and children are the starting point of education.;Yoshihiko Noda;education 16541;In our post-9/11 world, our Nation’s military deserves, at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy.;Mike Rogers;education 16542;I’m sure everything has a bearing on what I’m doing. My family is a lower-middle-class family, there’s lots of children, seven brothers, two sisters grew up together, fighting with each other, went to school. My mother went to school up to 4th grade. My father went to school up to 8th grade. So that’s about the education level we had in the family.;Muhammad Yunus;education 16543;Such schemes take money from people who can least afford to spend it to support an unneeded bureaucracy that eats money people thought they were providing for education.;Jesse Helms;education 16544;Let people have an education and you can’t stop them.;La Monte Young;education 16545;If my career detour from special education to singing has done one thing, it has afforded me the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.;Clay Aiken;education 16546;I went to school for special education. I always assumed when I had the opportunity I would love to try and help kids with disabilities.;Clay Aiken;education 16547;I did get a degree in special education.;Clay Aiken;education 16548;Years ago nobody was elected on the economic ticket. It was either the education platform, or it was health or it was other issues. It is only recently that economic values have superceded every other human value.;Anita Roddick;education 16549;The education cuts in the President’s budget are both irresponsible and morally unjustifiable.;Chaka Fattah;education 16550;I hope to focus on what I’m passionate about because I think I’d do them best job on them - education, urban education, women and children’s issues and literacy.;Jenna Bush;education 16551;I don’t think of myself as a policy expert. I think education is the most important thing.;Jenna Bush;education 16552;My father made sure that I had lots of levels of education - from ballroom-dancing to painting, commando training, theatre and magic.;Baz Luhrmann;education 16553;The parent knows instinctively that if they’re working and setting an example for their child that means that child is more likely to be in school, more likely to stay out of trouble and more likely to complete their education.;John Engler;education 16554;The first big break was winning a scholarship to go to Cambridge University. I was very lucky, because my parents couldn’t have afforded a university education for me. Without a scholarship I couldn’t possibly have gone.;Trevor Nunn;education 16555;Except among those whose education has been in the minimalist style, it is understood that hasty moral judgments about the past are a form of injustice.;Jacques Barzun;education 16556;Education is what remains when we have forgotten all that we have been taught.;George Savile;education 16557;I was in fashion school, my brother has a law background, and my sister-in-law had worked in production, but none of us had a proper fashion business education.;Alexander Wang;education 16558;No one should be denied the opportunity to get an education and increase their earning potential based solely on their inability to pay for a college education.;Bobby Scott;education 16559;Studies have shown that inmate participation in education, vocational and job training, prison work skills development, drug abuse, mental health and other treatment programs, all reduce recidivism, significantly.;Bobby Scott;education 16560;Unfortunately, the elimination of incentives such as parole, good time credits and funding for college courses, means that fewer inmates participate in and excel in literacy, education, treatment and other development programs.;Bobby Scott;education 16561;In the Brown decision, the United States Supreme Court unanimously struck down the legal and moral footing of racially segregated public education in this country.;Bobby Scott;education 16562;Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.;Bobby Scott;education 16563;A college education shows a man how little other people know.;Thomas Chandler Haliburton;education 16564;As long as she is talented enough and passionate about doing it herself then I will be happy and support her. I think I will be sensible - my parents said I could only do it if I got my education and so I had something to fall back on.;Anna Friel;education 16565;After completing a Delaware State education, they were afforded opportunities beyond anything they might have imagined - and they opened doors for themselves that surely would have remained closed if they only had a high school education.;Michael N. Castle;education 16566;By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N. Castle;education 16567;Delaware State began as a school bent on service - teaching education, social services and nursing.;Michael N. Castle;education 16568;They were often the first students in their family to go to college and the very idea of higher education was still foreign to them. They had to make a conscious and often difficult decision to come to college.;Michael N. Castle;education 16569;This is a value-added college education if I have heard one described. And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education 16570;What we’re doing now is we’re saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what’s truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we’re taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education 16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education 16574;I also found that for myself, since I’ve had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education 16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S. Coleman;education 16576;I scored a 910 on my SAT. I didn’t care about education. I don’t know what I cared about.;Skeet Ulrich;education 16577;Because if you don’t have a great workforce, a great higher education system, you’re not going to have the next eBay, the next AmGen, the next, you know, Miasole, and not only California but America is going to fall behind a whole new competitive context which is obviously China, India, and other countries.;Meg Whitman;education 16578;You can’t stand for too many things. You can’t use the bully pulpit for too many things. So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education 16579;It’s commonly said that people who’ve been ill in childhood and who’ve had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don’t look at the world in the way that other people do, and if you were inclined to be a writer, that’s a help.;John Keegan;education 16580;I think we spend too much on K-12 education a.k.a. teachers’ salaries. It’s the only industry where you never see any productivity increases.;Peter Brimelow;education 16581;I’d like to work with kids in special education - younger kids.;John Madden;education 16582;The U.S. tries to provide immigrants who grow up here with a world-class education and imbue them with the can-do attitude that has long defined American innovation.;Gary Locke;education 16583;I think the most important issue for all of us is our economy and jobs and creating opportunities for young people to be able to get the education that you need to be able to afford to go to college.;Debbie Stabenow;education 16584;When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.;Omar Bongo;education 16585;I did get a very fine education, and not just in science. It took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that I really should take an interest in humanities.;Joshua Lederberg;education 16586;I think of it as a good opportunity to let, in particular, school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it’s not just for a select group of people.;Ellen Ochoa;education 16587;My mum and dad had worked incredibly hard to afford me an education.;Benedict Cumberbatch;education 16588;My parents always made education and school the number one priority.

Why is it like that?’ Sometimes that questioning leads to something more.;Alice Englert;education 16605;The very effect of the education they were given… was to make men think and, thinking, they became less and less satisfied with the miserable pays they received.;John Grierson;education 16606;I have a greater goal - to empower young people through music education.;Ruben Studdard;education 16607;Our mother was a very religious and observant Jew, our father less so.

Modernization, updating education facilities, and making a capital investment in education are all included.;Major Owens;education 16613;Education technology is very important because we have a massive challenge in public schools.;Major Owens;education 16614;Excitement in education and student productivity, the ability to get a result that you want from students, go together and cannot be separated.;Major Owens;education 16615;I will continue my activities related to education in one way or another. I certainly would have at the top my agenda, with respect to education, the need to do much better with modern educational technology.;Major Owens;education 16616;The American Dream is still alive out there, and hard work will get you there. You don’t necessarily need to have an Ivy League education or to have millions of dollars startup money. It can be done with an idea, hard work and determination.;Bill Rancic;education 16617;My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children.

Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful. And what we in the Republican Party and across the country, Republican, Independents and Democrat women say is we’re more thoughtful than a label. We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education 16623;I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an actor. I never even thought about other careers. The acting field is certainly not the path many Indian parents encourage their children to take, but mine were very supportive. They wanted me to have an education, but understood that this is what I wanted to do.;Archie Panjabi;education 16624;Let them be reassured, it has never been one of our intentions to ban religion in society, but solely to protect the national education system from any conspicuous display of religious affiliation.;Jean-Pierre Raffarin;education 16625;Iran is not a make-believe country.

But it’s the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don’t have it.;Edward James Olmos;education 16629;Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.;Rutherford B.

With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education 16631;I am less disposed to think of a West Point education as requisite for this business than I was at first. Good sense and energy are the qualities required.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education 16632;Many seventh graders I know in Illinois, as well as around the Nation, are studying the Constitution.

Lack of education does not cause terrorism.;John O. Brennan;education 16641;You look at public education system, charter schools, infrastructure, in so many ways New Orleans has come back stronger.;Drew Brees;education 16642;I came up poor. My mother only had a fourth-grade education. My dad didn’t have any education at all. But they were very structured. They worked hard. You know, they didn’t complain. They didn’t murmur. And they believe in the Christ.;Evander Holyfield;education 16643;Listen, if the mayor wants to have a debate about education in this city, I got three words: bring it on.;Anthony Weiner;education 16644;Freedom Summer, the massive voter education project in Mississippi, was 1964. I graduated from high school in 1965. So becoming active was almost a rite of passage.;Danny Glover;education 16645;It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program. What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.;Alan Perlis;education 16646;I’ve seen people with a tremendous amount of educational background in the field not turn out to be terribly good actors, and I’ve seen people with no education in the field turn out to be people that I admire quite a bit.;Ron Silver;education 16647;Fully 57 percent of American college students are women.

As women continue to draw on experience and education, they’re accelerating their numbers in upper management, too.;Suzanne Fields;education 16648;I tell young people to prepare themselves as best they can for a world that grows more challenging every day-get the best education they can, and couple that education with real-life experience in social justice work.;Julian Bond;education 16649;We must ensure our system of higher education offers world-class quality for a world-class economy.;Bob Taft;education 16650;My idea of the ideal sex education site doesn’t exist.;Susie Bright;education 16651;Community colleges are one of America’s great social inventions a gateway to the future for first time students looking for an affordable college education, and for mid-career students looking to get ahead in the workplace.;Barbara Mikulski;education 16652;Most Hispanics are concerned with the same issues other Americans are - the economy, jobs, education. Similar to Main Street America.;Henry Bonilla;education 16653;And I thought that was the best way for me to participate, because standing in the crowd and listening is a fantastic education, but it’s not my nature.

I found it dull and I preferred to cause chaos and have fun. I regret this massively now.;Dominic Cooper;education 16658;The people in Iraq lived essentially good lives.

As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education 16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education 16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;education 16515;Further Education should be about the ability to learn, not the ability to pay - everyone who is able should have the opportunity, regardless of their family background. I don’t want to see students struggling with huge debts or frightened off even going to university in the first place.;Charles Kennedy;education 16516;But I like going to church.

A good calf is better than a good head.;Agnes de Mille;education 16518;In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you’re a theater actor it’s very difficult to make a living.

A thousand voices call to us on every hand, but our ears are stopped with wisdom.;Jean Giraudoux;education 16523;At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.;William John Wills;education 16524;Making the City Of Joy gave me the best political education of my life.

It’s inevitable that I’ll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education 16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country.

And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education 16570;What we’re doing now is we’re saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what’s truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we’re taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education 16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education 16574;I also found that for myself, since I’ve had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education 16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S.

So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education 16579;It’s commonly said that people who’ve been ill in childhood and who’ve had an upset education never really regret that they do.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Friends’ was an education in intelligent comedic banter in intelligent vernacular. It was an education in scene study. It was an education in group dynamic. I came out of there with a master’s degree in comedy.;Matt LeBlanc;education 16506;About half my work in education is U.S. political reform around school districts and charter schools, and creating more room for entrepreneurial organizations to develop. And about half on technology, which I look at as a global platform.;Reed Hastings;education 16507;What’s got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education 16508;Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want. In other words, there’s an education level that plays into the mix and so if it’s inexpensive to buy an hour of real good education in places like China versus the U.S., that factors in.;Ray Dalio;education 16509;I was really fortunate growing up to have a broad musical education. My parents listened to all kinds of music, rock, soul, Motown, jazz, Frank Sinatra, everything.;Mayer Hawthorne;education 16510;A liberal education… frees a man from the prison-house of his class, race, time, place, background, family and even his nation.;Robert M. Hutchins;education 16511;Many thousands of youth have been deprived of the benefit of education thereby, their morals ruined, and talents irretrievably lost to society, for want of cultivation: while two parties have been idly contending who should bestow it.;Joseph Lancaster;education 16512;When I enrolled in college at age 19, I had a total of eight years of formal classroom education. As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education 16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education 16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;education 16515;Further Education should be about the ability to learn, not the ability to pay - everyone who is able should have the opportunity, regardless of their family background. I don’t want to see students struggling with huge debts or frightened off even going to university in the first place.;Charles Kennedy;education 16516;But I like going to church. If you’ve been brought up in the Church of England, it feels like visiting an elderly relative. And I think it’s important that part of the kids’ education is knowing about the Bible.;Jack Dee;education 16517;A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.;Agnes de Mille;education 16518;In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you’re a theater actor it’s very difficult to make a living. But it’s also a very beautiful pathway to knowledge and to an open education.;Gael Garcia Bernal;education 16519;I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have.;George J. Mitchell;education 16520;I don’t want to scrounge around and be homeless, and I want to finish my education.;Callan McAuliffe;education 16521;It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current. So you do have to stay current to maintain your license even if you are not practicing.;Frank Shorter;education 16522;Education makes us more stupid than the brutes. A thousand voices call to us on every hand, but our ears are stopped with wisdom.;Jean Giraudoux;education 16523;At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.;William John Wills;education 16524;Making the City Of Joy gave me the best political education of my life. It became a wrestling match between an Englishman who had gradually ceased to be a Marxist, and a culture that was becoming more Marxist by the day.;Roland Joffe;education 16525;In my home State of Louisiana, several institutions of higher education have been impacted by both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, literally dozens across the entire State.;Bobby Jindal;education 16526;Poorer students take out larger loans and will have to contribute more to the cost of higher education.;Anne Campbell;education 16527;There is still a lot of misinformation being spread about higher education funding arrangements under the new Act. The students page on my website sets out the main points in the Act.;Anne Campbell;education 16528;Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can’t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.;Bjorn Lomborg;education 16529;And really, the basis, I think, of achieving some success in what I want to do today comes from my mother’s push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education.;Sam Donaldson;education 16530;The amount of money we spend on education is important, but not nearly as important as how the money is spent.;Bob Riley;education 16531;Ladies and gentlemen: There can be no greater investment in Alabama’s future than an investment in education.;Bob Riley;education 16532;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;education 16533;The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education. They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave.;Rick Santorum;education 16534;I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.;Kamala Harris;education 16535;Each year, I say I’m going to go to school next year. It’s inevitable that I’ll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education 16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country. It is an open door for drugs, criminals, and potential terrorists to enter our country. It is straining our economy, adding costs to our judicial, healthcare, and education systems.;Timothy Murphy;education 16537;For this reason, to study English literature without some general knowledge of the relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave one’s literary education very incomplete.;Lafcadio Hearn;education 16538;The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.;Liberty Hyde Bailey;education 16539;There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.;Marvin Hamlisch;education 16540;Interactions between fathers and children are the starting point of education.;Yoshihiko Noda;education 16541;In our post-9/11 world, our Nation’s military deserves, at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy.;Mike Rogers;education 16542;I’m sure everything has a bearing on what I’m doing. My family is a lower-middle-class family, there’s lots of children, seven brothers, two sisters grew up together, fighting with each other, went to school. My mother went to school up to 4th grade. My father went to school up to 8th grade. So that’s about the education level we had in the family.;Muhammad Yunus;education 16543;Such schemes take money from people who can least afford to spend it to support an unneeded bureaucracy that eats money people thought they were providing for education.;Jesse Helms;education 16544;Let people have an education and you can’t stop them.;La Monte Young;education 16545;If my career detour from special education to singing has done one thing, it has afforded me the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.;Clay Aiken;education 16546;I went to school for special education. I always assumed when I had the opportunity I would love to try and help kids with disabilities.;Clay Aiken;education 16547;I did get a degree in special education.;Clay Aiken;education 16548;Years ago nobody was elected on the economic ticket. It was either the education platform, or it was health or it was other issues. It is only recently that economic values have superceded every other human value.;Anita Roddick;education 16549;The education cuts in the President’s budget are both irresponsible and morally unjustifiable.;Chaka Fattah;education 16550;I hope to focus on what I’m passionate about because I think I’d do them best job on them - education, urban education, women and children’s issues and literacy.;Jenna Bush;education 16551;I don’t think of myself as a policy expert. I think education is the most important thing.;Jenna Bush;education 16552;My father made sure that I had lots of levels of education - from ballroom-dancing to painting, commando training, theatre and magic.;Baz Luhrmann;education 16553;The parent knows instinctively that if they’re working and setting an example for their child that means that child is more likely to be in school, more likely to stay out of trouble and more likely to complete their education.;John Engler;education 16554;The first big break was winning a scholarship to go to Cambridge University. I was very lucky, because my parents couldn’t have afforded a university education for me. Without a scholarship I couldn’t possibly have gone.;Trevor Nunn;education 16555;Except among those whose education has been in the minimalist style, it is understood that hasty moral judgments about the past are a form of injustice.;Jacques Barzun;education 16556;Education is what remains when we have forgotten all that we have been taught.;George Savile;education 16557;I was in fashion school, my brother has a law background, and my sister-in-law had worked in production, but none of us had a proper fashion business education.;Alexander Wang;education 16558;No one should be denied the opportunity to get an education and increase their earning potential based solely on their inability to pay for a college education.;Bobby Scott;education 16559;Studies have shown that inmate participation in education, vocational and job training, prison work skills development, drug abuse, mental health and other treatment programs, all reduce recidivism, significantly.;Bobby Scott;education 16560;Unfortunately, the elimination of incentives such as parole, good time credits and funding for college courses, means that fewer inmates participate in and excel in literacy, education, treatment and other development programs.;Bobby Scott;education 16561;In the Brown decision, the United States Supreme Court unanimously struck down the legal and moral footing of racially segregated public education in this country.;Bobby Scott;education 16562;Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.;Bobby Scott;education 16563;A college education shows a man how little other people know.;Thomas Chandler Haliburton;education 16564;As long as she is talented enough and passionate about doing it herself then I will be happy and support her. I think I will be sensible - my parents said I could only do it if I got my education and so I had something to fall back on.;Anna Friel;education 16565;After completing a Delaware State education, they were afforded opportunities beyond anything they might have imagined - and they opened doors for themselves that surely would have remained closed if they only had a high school education.;Michael N. Castle;education 16566;By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N. Castle;education 16567;Delaware State began as a school bent on service - teaching education, social services and nursing.;Michael N. Castle;education 16568;They were often the first students in their family to go to college and the very idea of higher education was still foreign to them. They had to make a conscious and often difficult decision to come to college.;Michael N. Castle;education 16569;This is a value-added college education if I have heard one described. And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education 16570;What we’re doing now is we’re saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what’s truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we’re taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education 16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education 16574;I also found that for myself, since I’ve had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education 16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S. Coleman;education 16576;I scored a 910 on my SAT. I didn’t care about education. I don’t know what I cared about.;Skeet Ulrich;education 16577;Because if you don’t have a great workforce, a great higher education system, you’re not going to have the next eBay, the next AmGen, the next, you know, Miasole, and not only California but America is going to fall behind a whole new competitive context which is obviously China, India, and other countries.;Meg Whitman;education 16578;You can’t stand for too many things. You can’t use the bully pulpit for too many things. So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education 16579;It’s commonly said that people who’ve been ill in childhood and who’ve had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don’t look at the world in the way that other people do, and if you were inclined to be a writer, that’s a help.;John Keegan;education 16580;I think we spend too much on K-12 education a.k.a. teachers’ salaries. It’s the only industry where you never see any productivity increases.;Peter Brimelow;education 16581;I’d like to work with kids in special education - younger kids.;John Madden;education 16582;The U.S. tries to provide immigrants who grow up here with a world-class education and imbue them with the can-do attitude that has long defined American innovation.;Gary Locke;education 16583;I think the most important issue for all of us is our economy and jobs and creating opportunities for young people to be able to get the education that you need to be able to afford to go to college.;Debbie Stabenow;education 16584;When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.;Omar Bongo;education 16585;I did get a very fine education, and not just in science. It took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that I really should take an interest in humanities.;Joshua Lederberg;education 16586;I think of it as a good opportunity to let, in particular, school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it’s not just for a select group of people.;Ellen Ochoa;education 16587;My mum and dad had worked incredibly hard to afford me an education.;Benedict Cumberbatch;education 16588;My parents always made education and school the number one priority. They believed that an education is the best gift you can give to your child.;Debra Messing;education 16589;The message of women’s liberation is that women can love each other and ourselves against our degrading education.;Jane Rule;education 16590;The Recovery plan will put money in the pockets of the American worker, create and save millions of new jobs and invest in crucial areas such as health care, education, energy independence and a new infrastructure.;Valerie Jarrett;education 16591;We’re failing our children with education, we’re failing our environment.;Carol Moseley Braun;education 16592;I’m committed to universal health coverage and education.;Carol Moseley Braun;education 16593;I am a firm believer in education and have worked very hard to tell young Latinos that they must go to college and that, if possible, they should pursue an advanced degree. I am convinced that education is the great equalizer.;Jimmy Smits;education 16594;Good education means learning to read, write and most importantly learn how to learn so that you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up.;Patty Murray;education 16595;I realized that I would have some very tough sledding, and I was very discouraged because I didn’t see much hope of getting into the field I wanted to get into with no college education.;Clyde Tombaugh;education 16596;It was depressing, very depressing. I worried about how I would make a living. I didn’t want to stay on the farm. It didn’t offer the challenge I wanted and yet, without a college education, I felt that I was really out of luck.;Clyde Tombaugh;education 16597;My job is to make sure that if you’re a family in Florida, your children can get a good education and you have the opportunity for a job. That’s my job and that’s what I think about every day.;Rick Scott;education 16598;Unless we make education a priority, an entire generation of Americans could miss out on the American dream.;Blanche Lincoln;education 16599;I do think that a general liberal arts education is very important, particularly in an uncertain changing world.;Steve Case;education 16600;So what it boils down to, in my humble opinion, is that we need to support the arts in schools, and at every other level in the education of children.;Phil Lesh;education 16601;Education should be one of our top funding priorities talking about it does not help the teachers and students who desperately need promises fulfilled.;Solomon Ortiz;education 16602;Education makes children less dependent upon others and opens doors to better jobs and career possibilities.;Solomon Ortiz;education 16603;Education is the silver bullet to improve this Nation’s standing worldwide… and our teachers know that.;Solomon Ortiz;education 16604;I think that every child grows up with the ideas that what we are given, is our society. Your education, and your mother and father, they tell you this is how it is, but then you hit adolescence and you think, ‘Is it? Why? Why is it like that?’ Sometimes that questioning leads to something more.;Alice Englert;education 16605;The very effect of the education they were given… was to make men think and, thinking, they became less and less satisfied with the miserable pays they received.;John Grierson;education 16606;I have a greater goal - to empower young people through music education.;Ruben Studdard;education 16607;Our mother was a very religious and observant Jew, our father less so. She was kind of driving the religious education, so for us it was more a burden and an obligation when we were kids at that age.;Joel Coen;education 16608;Health and education are always issues.;Helen Clark;education 16609;And I’m very surprised that all this stuff actually worked out to where I could have a career in film, gain the benefit of my education, and be thankful that I was able to break into my craft as an actor.;Terrence Howard;education 16610;If it is the duty of the State to educate, it is the duty of the State also to bear the burden of education, namely, the taxation out of which education is provided.;Edmund Barton;education 16611;It’s amazing to me that they’re cutting physical education programs in the school systems.;Shannon Miller;education 16612;Education technology and school construction go together. Modernization, updating education facilities, and making a capital investment in education are all included.;Major Owens;education 16613;Education technology is very important because we have a massive challenge in public schools.;Major Owens;education 16614;Excitement in education and student productivity, the ability to get a result that you want from students, go together and cannot be separated.;Major Owens;education 16615;I will continue my activities related to education in one way or another. I certainly would have at the top my agenda, with respect to education, the need to do much better with modern educational technology.;Major Owens;education 16616;The American Dream is still alive out there, and hard work will get you there. You don’t necessarily need to have an Ivy League education or to have millions of dollars startup money. It can be done with an idea, hard work and determination.;Bill Rancic;education 16617;My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children. I have two brothers and they worked dog hard to give us an education and provide us with the most comfortable life possible. My dad provided for his family daily. So, yes, that is definitely in my DNA.;David Oyelowo;education 16618;Parents should conduct their arguments in quiet, respectful tones, but in a foreign language. You’d be surprised what an inducement that is to the education of children.;Judith Martin;education 16619;A university is not a political party, and an education is not an indoctrination.;David Horowitz;education 16620;I’ve been working with the National Lung Health Education Program to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.;Loni Anderson;education 16621;We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around.;Ryan White;education 16622;There is no war on women. Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful. And what we in the Republican Party and across the country, Republican, Independents and Democrat women say is we’re more thoughtful than a label. We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education 16623;I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an actor. I never even thought about other careers. The acting field is certainly not the path many Indian parents encourage their children to take, but mine were very supportive. They wanted me to have an education, but understood that this is what I wanted to do.;Archie Panjabi;education 16624;Let them be reassured, it has never been one of our intentions to ban religion in society, but solely to protect the national education system from any conspicuous display of religious affiliation.;Jean-Pierre Raffarin;education 16625;Iran is not a make-believe country. It is a real country populated by some 75 million people - real people including, I daresay, a majority who are philosophically and by education inclined toward the modern, secular world, and particularly American values.;Bob Barr;education 16626;Napoleon was probably the equal at least of Washington in intellect, his superior in education. Both of them were successful in serving the state.;Matthew Simpson;education 16627;Education is a vacine for violence.;Edward James Olmos;education 16628;Education is the key. But it’s the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don’t have it.;Edward James Olmos;education 16629;Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education 16630;Law without education is a dead letter. With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.;Rutherford B.

I came out of there with a master's degree in comedy.;Matt LeBlanc;education 16506;About half my work in education is U.S. political reform around school districts and charter schools, and creating more room for entrepreneurial organizations to develop. And about half on technology, which I look at as a global platform.;Reed Hastings;education 16507;What's got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education 16508;Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want. In other words, there's an education level that plays into the mix and so if it's inexpensive to buy an hour of real good education in places like China versus the U.S., that factors in.;Ray Dalio;education 16509;I was really fortunate growing up to have a broad musical education.

As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education 16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education 16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils.

It's inevitable that I'll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education 16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country. It is an open door for drugs, criminals, and potential terrorists to enter our country.

Castle;education 16566;By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N.

Castle;education 16568;They were often the first students in their family to go to college and the very idea of higher education was still foreign to them. They had to make a conscious and often difficult decision to come to college.;Michael N. Castle;education 16569;This is a value-added college education if I have heard one described. And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education 16570;What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what's truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education 16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education 16574;I also found that for myself, since I've had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education 16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S.

So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education 16579;It's commonly said that people who've been ill in childhood and who've had an upset education never really regret that they do.

But it's the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don't have it.;Edward James Olmos;education 16629;Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.;Rutherford B.

As women continue to draw on experience and education, they're accelerating their numbers in upper management, too.;Suzanne Fields;education 16648;I tell young people to prepare themselves as best they can for a world that grows more challenging every day-get the best education they can, and couple that education with real-life experience in social justice work.;Julian Bond;education 16649;We must ensure our system of higher education offers world-class quality for a world-class economy.;Bob Taft;education 16650;My idea of the ideal sex education site doesn't exist.;Susie Bright;education 16651;Community colleges are one of America's great social inventions a gateway to the future for first time students looking for an affordable college education, and for mid-career students looking to get ahead in the workplace.;Barbara Mikulski;education 16652;Most Hispanics are concerned with the same issues other Americans are - the economy, jobs, education.

<p>Friends’ was an education in intelligent comedic banter in intelligent vernacular. It was an education in scene study. It was an education in group dynamic. I came out of there with a master’s degree in comedy.;Matt LeBlanc;education
16506;About half my work in education is U.S. political reform around school districts and charter schools, and creating more room for entrepreneurial organizations to develop. And about half on technology, which I look at as a global platform.;Reed Hastings;education
16507;What’s got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education
16508;Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want. In other words, there’s an education level that plays into the mix and so if it’s inexpensive to buy an hour of real good education in places like China versus the U.S., that factors in.;Ray Dalio;education
16509;I was really fortunate growing up to have a broad musical education. My parents listened to all kinds of music, rock, soul, Motown, jazz, Frank Sinatra, everything.;Mayer Hawthorne;education
16510;A liberal education… frees a man from the prison-house of his class, race, time, place, background, family and even his nation.;Robert M. Hutchins;education
16511;Many thousands of youth have been deprived of the benefit of education thereby, their morals ruined, and talents irretrievably lost to society, for want of cultivation: while two parties have been idly contending who should bestow it.;Joseph Lancaster;education
16512;When I enrolled in college at age 19, I had a total of eight years of formal classroom education. As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education
16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education
16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;education
16515;Further Education should be about the ability to learn, not the ability to pay - everyone who is able should have the opportunity, regardless of their family background. I don’t want to see students struggling with huge debts or frightened off even going to university in the first place.;Charles Kennedy;education
16516;But I like going to church. If you’ve been brought up in the Church of England, it feels like visiting an elderly relative. And I think it’s important that part of the kids’ education is knowing about the Bible.;Jack Dee;education
16517;A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.;Agnes de Mille;education
16518;In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you’re a theater actor it’s very difficult to make a living. But it’s also a very beautiful pathway to knowledge and to an open education.;Gael Garcia Bernal;education
16519;I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have.;George J. Mitchell;education
16520;I don’t want to scrounge around and be homeless, and I want to finish my education.;Callan McAuliffe;education
16521;It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current. So you do have to stay current to maintain your license even if you are not practicing.;Frank Shorter;education
16522;Education makes us more stupid than the brutes. A thousand voices call to us on every hand, but our ears are stopped with wisdom.;Jean Giraudoux;education
16523;At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.;William John Wills;education
16524;Making the City Of Joy gave me the best political education of my life. It became a wrestling match between an Englishman who had gradually ceased to be a Marxist, and a culture that was becoming more Marxist by the day.;Roland Joffe;education
16525;In my home State of Louisiana, several institutions of higher education have been impacted by both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, literally dozens across the entire State.;Bobby Jindal;education
16526;Poorer students take out larger loans and will have to contribute more to the cost of higher education.;Anne Campbell;education
16527;There is still a lot of misinformation being spread about higher education funding arrangements under the new Act. The students page on my website sets out the main points in the Act.;Anne Campbell;education
16528;Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can’t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.;Bjorn Lomborg;education
16529;And really, the basis, I think, of achieving some success in what I want to do today comes from my mother’s push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education.;Sam Donaldson;education
16530;The amount of money we spend on education is important, but not nearly as important as how the money is spent.;Bob Riley;education
16531;Ladies and gentlemen: There can be no greater investment in Alabama’s future than an investment in education.;Bob Riley;education
16532;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;education
16533;The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education. They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave.;Rick Santorum;education
16534;I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.;Kamala Harris;education
16535;Each year, I say I’m going to go to school next year. It’s inevitable that I’ll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education
16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country. It is an open door for drugs, criminals, and potential terrorists to enter our country. It is straining our economy, adding costs to our judicial, healthcare, and education systems.;Timothy Murphy;education
16537;For this reason, to study English literature without some general knowledge of the relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave one’s literary education very incomplete.;Lafcadio Hearn;education
16538;The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.;Liberty Hyde Bailey;education
16539;There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.;Marvin Hamlisch;education
16540;Interactions between fathers and children are the starting point of education.;Yoshihiko Noda;education
16541;In our post-9/11 world, our Nation’s military deserves, at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy.;Mike Rogers;education
16542;I’m sure everything has a bearing on what I’m doing. My family is a lower-middle-class family, there’s lots of children, seven brothers, two sisters grew up together, fighting with each other, went to school. My mother went to school up to 4th grade. My father went to school up to 8th grade. So that’s about the education level we had in the family.;Muhammad Yunus;education
16543;Such schemes take money from people who can least afford to spend it to support an unneeded bureaucracy that eats money people thought they were providing for education.;Jesse Helms;education
16544;Let people have an education and you can’t stop them.;La Monte Young;education
16545;If my career detour from special education to singing has done one thing, it has afforded me the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.;Clay Aiken;education
16546;I went to school for special education. I always assumed when I had the opportunity I would love to try and help kids with disabilities.;Clay Aiken;education
16547;I did get a degree in special education.;Clay Aiken;education
16548;Years ago nobody was elected on the economic ticket. It was either the education platform, or it was health or it was other issues. It is only recently that economic values have superceded every other human value.;Anita Roddick;education
16549;The education cuts in the President’s budget are both irresponsible and morally unjustifiable.;Chaka Fattah;education
16550;I hope to focus on what I’m passionate about because I think I’d do them best job on them - education, urban education, women and children’s issues and literacy.;Jenna Bush;education
16551;I don’t think of myself as a policy expert. I think education is the most important thing.;Jenna Bush;education
16552;My father made sure that I had lots of levels of education - from ballroom-dancing to painting, commando training, theatre and magic.;Baz Luhrmann;education
16553;The parent knows instinctively that if they’re working and setting an example for their child that means that child is more likely to be in school, more likely to stay out of trouble and more likely to complete their education.;John Engler;education
16554;The first big break was winning a scholarship to go to Cambridge University. I was very lucky, because my parents couldn’t have afforded a university education for me. Without a scholarship I couldn’t possibly have gone.;Trevor Nunn;education
16555;Except among those whose education has been in the minimalist style, it is understood that hasty moral judgments about the past are a form of injustice.;Jacques Barzun;education
16556;Education is what remains when we have forgotten all that we have been taught.;George Savile;education
16557;I was in fashion school, my brother has a law background, and my sister-in-law had worked in production, but none of us had a proper fashion business education.;Alexander Wang;education
16558;No one should be denied the opportunity to get an education and increase their earning potential based solely on their inability to pay for a college education.;Bobby Scott;education
16559;Studies have shown that inmate participation in education, vocational and job training, prison work skills development, drug abuse, mental health and other treatment programs, all reduce recidivism, significantly.;Bobby Scott;education
16560;Unfortunately, the elimination of incentives such as parole, good time credits and funding for college courses, means that fewer inmates participate in and excel in literacy, education, treatment and other development programs.;Bobby Scott;education
16561;In the Brown decision, the United States Supreme Court unanimously struck down the legal and moral footing of racially segregated public education in this country.;Bobby Scott;education
16562;Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.;Bobby Scott;education
16563;A college education shows a man how little other people know.;Thomas Chandler Haliburton;education
16564;As long as she is talented enough and passionate about doing it herself then I will be happy and support her. I think I will be sensible - my parents said I could only do it if I got my education and so I had something to fall back on.;Anna Friel;education
16565;After completing a Delaware State education, they were afforded opportunities beyond anything they might have imagined - and they opened doors for themselves that surely would have remained closed if they only had a high school education.;Michael N. Castle;education
16566;By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N. Castle;education
16567;Delaware State began as a school bent on service - teaching education, social services and nursing.;Michael N. Castle;education
16568;They were often the first students in their family to go to college and the very idea of higher education was still foreign to them. They had to make a conscious and often difficult decision to come to college.;Michael N. Castle;education
16569;This is a value-added college education if I have heard one described. And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education
16570;What we’re doing now is we’re saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what’s truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we’re taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education
16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education
16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education
16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education
16574;I also found that for myself, since I’ve had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education
16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S. Coleman;education
16576;I scored a 910 on my SAT. I didn’t care about education. I don’t know what I cared about.;Skeet Ulrich;education
16577;Because if you don’t have a great workforce, a great higher education system, you’re not going to have the next eBay, the next AmGen, the next, you know, Miasole, and not only California but America is going to fall behind a whole new competitive context which is obviously China, India, and other countries.;Meg Whitman;education
16578;You can’t stand for too many things. You can’t use the bully pulpit for too many things. So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education
16579;It’s commonly said that people who’ve been ill in childhood and who’ve had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don’t look at the world in the way that other people do, and if you were inclined to be a writer, that’s a help.;John Keegan;education
16580;I think we spend too much on K-12 education a.k.a. teachers’ salaries. It’s the only industry where you never see any productivity increases.;Peter Brimelow;education
16581;I’d like to work with kids in special education - younger kids.;John Madden;education
16582;The U.S. tries to provide immigrants who grow up here with a world-class education and imbue them with the can-do attitude that has long defined American innovation.;Gary Locke;education
16583;I think the most important issue for all of us is our economy and jobs and creating opportunities for young people to be able to get the education that you need to be able to afford to go to college.;Debbie Stabenow;education
16584;When they favor the access of other people to education and health care, the countries of the North not only demonstrate generosity or solidarity, but also implement the principles of respecting and promoting human rights.;Omar Bongo;education
16585;I did get a very fine education, and not just in science. It took some pressure on the part of my elders to convince me that I really should take an interest in humanities.;Joshua Lederberg;education
16586;I think of it as a good opportunity to let, in particular, school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it’s not just for a select group of people.;Ellen Ochoa;education
16587;My mum and dad had worked incredibly hard to afford me an education.;Benedict Cumberbatch;education
16588;My parents always made education and school the number one priority. They believed that an education is the best gift you can give to your child.;Debra Messing;education
16589;The message of women’s liberation is that women can love each other and ourselves against our degrading education.;Jane Rule;education
16590;The Recovery plan will put money in the pockets of the American worker, create and save millions of new jobs and invest in crucial areas such as health care, education, energy independence and a new infrastructure.;Valerie Jarrett;education
16591;We’re failing our children with education, we’re failing our environment.;Carol Moseley Braun;education
16592;I’m committed to universal health coverage and education.;Carol Moseley Braun;education
16593;I am a firm believer in education and have worked very hard to tell young Latinos that they must go to college and that, if possible, they should pursue an advanced degree. I am convinced that education is the great equalizer.;Jimmy Smits;education
16594;Good education means learning to read, write and most importantly learn how to learn so that you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up.;Patty Murray;education
16595;I realized that I would have some very tough sledding, and I was very discouraged because I didn’t see much hope of getting into the field I wanted to get into with no college education.;Clyde Tombaugh;education
16596;It was depressing, very depressing. I worried about how I would make a living. I didn’t want to stay on the farm. It didn’t offer the challenge I wanted and yet, without a college education, I felt that I was really out of luck.;Clyde Tombaugh;education
16597;My job is to make sure that if you’re a family in Florida, your children can get a good education and you have the opportunity for a job. That’s my job and that’s what I think about every day.;Rick Scott;education
16598;Unless we make education a priority, an entire generation of Americans could miss out on the American dream.;Blanche Lincoln;education
16599;I do think that a general liberal arts education is very important, particularly in an uncertain changing world.;Steve Case;education
16600;So what it boils down to, in my humble opinion, is that we need to support the arts in schools, and at every other level in the education of children.;Phil Lesh;education
16601;Education should be one of our top funding priorities talking about it does not help the teachers and students who desperately need promises fulfilled.;Solomon Ortiz;education
16602;Education makes children less dependent upon others and opens doors to better jobs and career possibilities.;Solomon Ortiz;education
16603;Education is the silver bullet to improve this Nation’s standing worldwide… and our teachers know that.;Solomon Ortiz;education
16604;I think that every child grows up with the ideas that what we are given, is our society. Your education, and your mother and father, they tell you this is how it is, but then you hit adolescence and you think, ‘Is it? Why? Why is it like that?’ Sometimes that questioning leads to something more.;Alice Englert;education
16605;The very effect of the education they were given… was to make men think and, thinking, they became less and less satisfied with the miserable pays they received.;John Grierson;education
16606;I have a greater goal - to empower young people through music education.;Ruben Studdard;education
16607;Our mother was a very religious and observant Jew, our father less so. She was kind of driving the religious education, so for us it was more a burden and an obligation when we were kids at that age.;Joel Coen;education
16608;Health and education are always issues.;Helen Clark;education
16609;And I’m very surprised that all this stuff actually worked out to where I could have a career in film, gain the benefit of my education, and be thankful that I was able to break into my craft as an actor.;Terrence Howard;education
16610;If it is the duty of the State to educate, it is the duty of the State also to bear the burden of education, namely, the taxation out of which education is provided.;Edmund Barton;education
16611;It’s amazing to me that they’re cutting physical education programs in the school systems.;Shannon Miller;education
16612;Education technology and school construction go together. Modernization, updating education facilities, and making a capital investment in education are all included.;Major Owens;education
16613;Education technology is very important because we have a massive challenge in public schools.;Major Owens;education
16614;Excitement in education and student productivity, the ability to get a result that you want from students, go together and cannot be separated.;Major Owens;education
16615;I will continue my activities related to education in one way or another. I certainly would have at the top my agenda, with respect to education, the need to do much better with modern educational technology.;Major Owens;education
16616;The American Dream is still alive out there, and hard work will get you there. You don’t necessarily need to have an Ivy League education or to have millions of dollars startup money. It can be done with an idea, hard work and determination.;Bill Rancic;education
16617;My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children. I have two brothers and they worked dog hard to give us an education and provide us with the most comfortable life possible. My dad provided for his family daily. So, yes, that is definitely in my DNA.;David Oyelowo;education
16618;Parents should conduct their arguments in quiet, respectful tones, but in a foreign language. You’d be surprised what an inducement that is to the education of children.;Judith Martin;education
16619;A university is not a political party, and an education is not an indoctrination.;David Horowitz;education
16620;I’ve been working with the National Lung Health Education Program to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.;Loni Anderson;education
16621;We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around.;Ryan White;education
16622;There is no war on women. Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful. And what we in the Republican Party and across the country, Republican, Independents and Democrat women say is we’re more thoughtful than a label. We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education
16623;I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an actor. I never even thought about other careers. The acting field is certainly not the path many Indian parents encourage their children to take, but mine were very supportive. They wanted me to have an education, but understood that this is what I wanted to do.;Archie Panjabi;education
16624;Let them be reassured, it has never been one of our intentions to ban religion in society, but solely to protect the national education system from any conspicuous display of religious affiliation.;Jean-Pierre Raffarin;education
16625;Iran is not a make-believe country. It is a real country populated by some 75 million people - real people including, I daresay, a majority who are philosophically and by education inclined toward the modern, secular world, and particularly American values.;Bob Barr;education
16626;Napoleon was probably the equal at least of Washington in intellect, his superior in education. Both of them were successful in serving the state.;Matthew Simpson;education
16627;Education is a vacine for violence.;Edward James Olmos;education
16628;Education is the key. But it’s the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don’t have it.;Edward James Olmos;education
16629;Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need be, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education
16630;Law without education is a dead letter. With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education
