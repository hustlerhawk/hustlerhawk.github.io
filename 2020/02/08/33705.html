The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.;Lewis Thomas;knowledge 39451;The new industries are brainy industries and so-called knowledge workers tend to like to be near other people who are the same. Think of the City of Hollywood. People cluster. This means you have winning regions, such as London and Cambridge, and losing regions. The people who want to be top lawyers in Sunderland are hoovered up by London.;Evan Davis;knowledge 39452;A screen actor is compensated in the knowledge that millions will see his performance at one time, where only hundreds will see it on the stage.;Bela Lugosi;knowledge 39453;A man of knowledge chooses a path with a heart and follows it and then he looks and rejoices and laughs and then he sees and knows.;Carlos Castenada;knowledge 39454;Since ancient times, people from throughout Asia have brought to Japan their talents, knowledge and energy, helping to lay the basis for Japan’s existence as a country.;Daisaku Ikeda;knowledge 39455;A healthy vision of the future is not possible without an accurate knowledge of the past.;Daisaku Ikeda;knowledge 39456;A commitment to human rights cannot be fostered simply through the transmission of knowledge. Action and experience play a crucial role in the learning process.;Daisaku Ikeda;knowledge 39457;I believe that we must maintain pride in the knowledge that the actions we take, based on our own decisions and choices as individuals, link directly to the magnificent challenge of transforming human history.;Daisaku Ikeda;knowledge 39458;Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.;Louis Pasteur;knowledge 39459;While many hackers have the knowledge, skills, and tools to attack computer systems, they generally lack the motivation to cause violence or severe economic or social harm.;Dorothy Denning;knowledge 39460;It’s kind of interesting, because hacking is a skill that could be used for criminal purposes or legitimate purposes, and so even though in the past I was hacking for the curiosity, and the thrill, to get a bite of the forbidden fruit of knowledge, I’m now working in the security field as a public speaker.;Kevin Mitnick;knowledge 39461;I have always liked the idea of going to print because a big part of what we are about is to disseminate knowledge throughout the world and not just to people who have broadband.;Jimmy Wales;knowledge 39462;What can we put into the hands of people under oppressive regimes to help them? For me, a big part of it is information, knowledge - the ability to defeat propaganda by understanding it.;Jimmy Wales;knowledge 39463;Psychopaths know the technical difference between right and wrong - which is one of the reasons their insanity pleas in criminal cases so rarely succeed they just fail to act on that knowledge.;Jeffrey Kluger;knowledge 39464;Just like I find men who talk sports who don’t really know sports annoying, I think men might find women who don’t really have a true passion and knowledge of sports maybe not so attractive.;Gabrielle Union;knowledge 39465;I’m on a mission. And I know the older I get, I may lose a step or two, but it’s all up in the medulla oblongata. I’ve got a lot up there. I’ve got a lot of knowledge… in this medulla oblongata.;Shaquille O’Neal;knowledge 39466;People live longer today than they ever have. They live happier lives, have more knowledge, more information. All this is the result of communications technology. How is any of that bad?;Tom Clancy;knowledge 39467;Doubt is the middle position between knowledge and ignorance. It encompasses cynicism but also genuine questioning.;Vera Farmiga;knowledge 39468;In complete darkness, it is only knowledge and wisdom that separates us.;Janet Jackson;knowledge 39469;I think a lot of food shows, especially when we started ‘Good Eats’ back in the late ’90s, they were still really about food. ‘Good Eats’ isn’t about food, it’s about entertainment. If, however, we can virally infect you with knowledge or interest, then all the better.;Alton Brown;knowledge 39470;Epistemology is the study of knowledge. By what conduit do we know what we know?;Theodore Bikel;knowledge 39471;The education that prepared me was my general education classes, which I tried to avoid when I was a stupid undergraduate, but which gave me the foundation of general knowledge that makes a career as a writer possible.;Orson Scott Card;knowledge 39472;We give you the facts. I told you information is power - knowledge is power. We can’t be in an ideological battle to redeem the soul of this country if we don’t have the facts.;Tavis Smiley;knowledge 39473;In the past, I used to counter any such notions by asking myself: ‘Would you really want President Hattersley?’ I now find that possibility rather cheers me up. With his chubby, Dickensian features and his knowledge of T.H. Green and other harmless leftish political classics, Hattersley might not be such a bad thing after all.;A. N. Wilson;knowledge 39474;Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.;Jacob Bronowski;knowledge 39475;As writers become more numerous, it is natural for readers to become more indolent whence must necessarily arise a desire of attaining knowledge with the greatest possible ease.;Oliver Goldsmith;knowledge 39476;These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind. If elected I will use all my energy, skills, experience and knowledge to stand up for our communities and get things done for the better.;Lucy Powell;knowledge 39477;Scientific knowledge is a kind of discourse.;Jean-Francois Lyotard;knowledge 39478;It created a global platform that allowed more people to plug and play, collaborate and compete, share knowledge and share work, than anything we have ever seen in the history of the world.;Thomas Friedman;knowledge 39479;Even though I’m a hype man myself, I like the practicality of it all. People who understand how to turn a profit. At the end of the day, this is still business so I’m looking for real practical knowledge of how to actually make money, not necessarily raise it.;Gary Vaynerchuk;knowledge 39480;Behind the man is the Tree of Life, bearing twelve fruits, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is behind the woman the serpent is twining round it.;Arthur E. Waite;knowledge 39481;Today mythical thinking has fallen into disrepute we often dismiss it as irrational and self-indulgent. But the imagination is also the faculty that has enabled scientists to bring new knowledge to light and to invent technology that has made us immeasurably more effective.;Karen Armstrong;knowledge 39482;Compassion is a practically acquired knowledge, like dancing. You must do it and practice diligently day by day.;Karen Armstrong;knowledge 39483;Science has to be understood in its broadest sense, as a method for comprehending all observable reality, and not merely as an instrument for acquiring specialized knowledge.;Alexis Carrel;knowledge 39484;At each increase of knowledge, as well as on the contrivance of every new tool, human labour becomes abridged.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39485;It will be readily admitted, that a degree conferred by an university, ought to be a pledge to the public that he who holds it possesses a certain quantity of knowledge.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39486;Surely, if knowledge is valuable, it can never be good policy in a country far wealthier than Tuscany, to allow a genius like Mr. Dalton’s, to be employed in the drudgery of elementary instruction.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39487;That the state of knowledge in any country will exert a directive influence on the general system of instruction adopted in it, is a principle too obvious to require investigation.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39488;There is, however, another purpose to which academies contribute. When they consist of a limited number of persons, eminent for their knowledge, it becomes an object of ambition to be admitted on their list.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39489;To those who have chosen the profession of medicine, a knowledge of chemistry, and of some branches of natural history, and, indeed, of several other departments of science, affords useful assistance.;Charles Babbage;knowledge 39490;It’s just us trying to start a movement where everybody passes on a bit of cooking knowledge. We estimate that one person can potentially affect 180 others very quickly so we’re just trying to spread the word.;Jamie Oliver;knowledge 39491;To say, ‘well done’ to any bit of good work is to take hold of the powers which have made the effort and strengthen them beyond our knowledge.;Phillips Brooks;knowledge 39492;Knowledge conquered by labor becomes a possession - a property entirely our own.;Samuel Smiles;knowledge 39493;Every mind was made for growth, for knowledge, and its nature is sinned against when it is doomed to ignorance.;William Ellery Channing;knowledge 39494;As governor, I saw the link between economic prosperity and the ability to acquire knowledge.;Jeb Bush;knowledge 39495;But because many endeavor to get knowledge rather than to live well, they are often deceived and reap little or no benefit from their labor.;Thomas a Kempis;knowledge 39496;I am conscious of my inability to grasp, in all its details and positive developments, any very large portion of human knowledge.;Mikhail Bakunin;knowledge 39497;I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure.;Mikhail Bakunin;knowledge 39498;Scientific discovery and scientific knowledge have been achieved only by those who have gone in pursuit of it without any practical purpose whatsoever in view.;Max Planck;knowledge 39499;It takes most men five years to recover from a college education, and to learn that poetry is as vital to thinking as knowledge.;Brooks Atkinson;knowledge 39500;The knowledge that there is a part of the psychic functions that are out of conscious reach, we did not need to wait for Freud to know this!;Jacques Lacan;knowledge 39501;Most of my technical knowledge comes from having worked in the industrial video industry.;Richard King;knowledge 39502;Use your gifts faithfully, and they shall be enlarged practice what you know, and you shall attain to higher knowledge.;Matthew Arnold;knowledge 39503;Very few beings really seek knowledge in this world. Mortal or immortal, few really ASK. On the contrary, they try to wring from the unknown the answers they have already shaped in their own minds.;Anne Rice;knowledge 39504;My musical knowledge is so bad it’s embarrassing. When composers discuss music with someone as primitive as myself, they have to talk about it in terms of senses and emotion, rather than keys and tempo.;Jane Campion;knowledge 39505;My advice to women in general: Even if you’re doing a nine-to-five job, treat yourself like a boss. Not arrogant, but be sure of what you want - and don’t allow people to run anything for you without your knowledge.;Nicki Minaj;knowledge 39506;The knowledge of the realm of death makes it possible for the shaman to move freely back and forth and mediate these journeys for other people.;Stanislav Grof;knowledge 39507;Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.;Jimmy Wales;knowledge 39508;I think it’s a mistake to treat different realms of knowledge as if they are some how fundamentally the same.;Jimmy Wales;knowledge 39509;Have you heard of this new thing called the internet? It’s giving people new expectations. It’s allowing them to become their own expert. Knowledge lies anxious at their fingertips. Gloss over the truth in your advertising and you’ll quickly be dismissed as a poser.;Roy H. Williams;knowledge 39510;In order to the existence of such a ministry in the Church, there is requisite an authority received from God, and consequently power and knowledge imparted from God for the exercise of such ministry and where a man possesses these, although the bis.;John Wycliffe;knowledge 39511;Once we know of atrocities we cannot remain silent, and knowledge inevitably leads to an urge to protect the innocent.;Azar Nafisi;knowledge 39512;All wish to possess knowledge, but few, comparatively speaking, are willing to pay the price.;Juvenal;knowledge 39513;A man can only attain knowledge with the help of those who possess it.
