It’s a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don’t think it’s any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

They didn’t necessarily sign up for this.;Katy Perry;hope 36265;One thing I can’t do, and I hope that there are other people out there that feel the same way, is climb a rope.

I don’t think once.;Bob Uecker;hope 36342;When it comes down to it, it’s giving people a good night out in a basic way and I think my company guarantees that.

All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope 36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure.

And never hope more than you work.;Rita Mae Brown;hope 36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery’s version of the Barack Obama ‘Hope’ poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

Watts;hope 36402;I mean, why am I considered an ‘it girl?’ Because I’m in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that.

It’s a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don’t think it’s any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

I hope digital movies change that.;Ang Lee;hope 36279;Most of me was glad when my mother died. She was a handful, but not in a cute, festive way.

I don’t think once.;Bob Uecker;hope 36342;When it comes down to it, it’s giving people a good night out in a basic way and I think my company guarantees that.

I don’t think once.;Bob Uecker;hope 36342;When it comes down to it, it’s giving people a good night out in a basic way and I think my company guarantees that.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

And never hope more than you work.;Rita Mae Brown;hope 36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery's version of the Barack Obama 'Hope' poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope 36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn't have to promote myself. These days there's far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows. I hope the more didactic approach won't be lost.;David Attenborough;hope 36389;The climate, the economic situation, rising birth rates none of these things give me a lot of hope or reason to be optimistic.;David Attenborough;hope 36390;My fondest hope is that 'Roots' may start black, white, brown, red, yellow people digging back for their own roots.

And never hope more than you work.;Rita Mae Brown;hope 36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery's version of the Barack Obama 'Hope' poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

Watts;hope 36402;I mean, why am I considered an 'it girl?' Because I'm in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that.

It's not church. It's not serious.;Charles Barkley;hope 36411;For me, Barack Obama's election was a milestone of the most extraordinary kind. On the day he was elected I felt such hope in my heart.

I can just kind of hope that it happens.;Norah Jones;hope 36414;I hope there are some audiophiles still out there.;Norah Jones;hope 36415;You always hear people saying, 'I hope I'm not turning into my dad', but I'd be honoured if I became half as decent a bloke as he is.;Johnny Vegas;hope 36416;Before you give up hope, turn back and read the attacks that were made on Lincoln.;Bruce Barton;hope 36417;My hope was that organizations would start including this range of skills in their training programs - in other words, offer an adult education in social and emotional intelligence.;Daniel Goleman;hope 36418;I hope I live long enough to see every hungry school child in the world being fed under the so-called McGovern-Dole program.;George McGovern;hope 36419;I hope someday we will be able to proclaim that we have banished hunger in the United States, and that we've been able to bring nutrition and health to the whole world.;George McGovern;hope 36420;I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences.;Sonia Sotomayor;hope 36421;The only way of knowing a person is to love them without hope.;Walter Benjamin;hope 36422;My contribution I hope is to get people to eat full-flavored food.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life, I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.;Hugh Jackman;hope 36247;I think, my generation, it's hard to have hope when you got a $700-trillion derivatives debt to pay and a bubble about to explode and $500 trillion worth of GDP.;Shia LaBeouf;hope 36248;But maybe music was not intended to satisfy the curious definiteness of man.

Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one.;Marco Rubio;hope 36255;My mother was one of seven girls whose parents went to bed hungry so their children wouldn't.

I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.;Diablo Cody;hope 36375;Do parents sit down and tell their kids everything? I don't know. I don't know.

All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope 36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn't have to promote myself. These days there's far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows.

And never hope more than you work.;Rita Mae Brown;hope 36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery's version of the Barack Obama 'Hope' poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.;Diablo Cody;hope 36375;Do parents sit down and tell their kids everything? I don't know. I don't know.

People say, 'Studs, you're an optimist.' I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what's the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope 36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

36324;Hope is the cordial that keeps life from stagnating.;Samuel Richardson;hope

36331;I hope that Facebook and other Internet technologies were able to help people, just like we hope that we help them communicate and organize and do whatever they want to every single day, but I don’t pretend that if Facebook didn’t exist, that this wouldn’t even be possible. Of course, it would have.;Mark Zuckerberg;hope

36341;I hope the fans have enjoyed listening as much as I’ve enjoyed doing the games. I don’t ever go to the park where I don’t have a good day. I don’t like losing. But I don’t think I ever go to the park where I have a bad day. I don’t think once.;Bob Uecker;hope
36342;When it comes down to it, it’s giving people a good night out in a basic way and I think my company guarantees that. There’s always something new and something to excite us and surprise us, and that’s why people come back, I hope.;Matthew Bourne;hope

36348;It’s just a part of our nature to hope.;Elizabeth Edwards;hope

36364;My hope for my children must be that they respond to the still, small voice of God in their own hearts.;Andrew Young;hope

36366;I certainly hope I’m not still answering child-star questions by the time I reach menopause.;Christina Ricci;hope
36367;As long as we can tell stories about our ability to survive, the more we will hope, not self-destruct.;Christina Ricci;hope
36368;The attitude that nature is chaotic and that the artist puts order into it is a very absurd point of view, I think. All that we can hope for is to put some order into ourselves.;Willem de Kooning;hope
36369;I hope to bring people to God with my songs.;Mahalia Jackson;hope

36374;You know, it shouldn’t just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman’s perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I’m all about representation.;Diablo Cody;hope
36375;Do parents sit down and tell their kids everything? I don’t know. I don’t know. I’ve convinced myself - I hope I’m right - that children despair of you if you don’t tell them the truth.;Maurice Sendak;hope
36376;I’ve convinced myself - I hope I’m right - that children despair of you if you don’t tell them the truth.;Maurice Sendak;hope

36387;All we can hope for is that the thing is going to slowly and imperceptibly shift. All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.;David Attenborough;hope
36388;I had a huge advantage when I started 50 years ago - my job was secure. I didn’t have to promote myself. These days there’s far more pressure to make a mark, so the temptation is to make adventure television or personality shows. I hope the more didactic approach won’t be lost.;David Attenborough;hope

36395;There is something uniquely depressing about the fact that the National Portrait Gallery’s version of the Barack Obama ‘Hope’ poster previously belonged to a pair of lobbyists.

36396;I mean, I get letters in the mail because I had a heart defect when I was one, I had surgeries and stuff.

36401;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;hope
36402;I mean, why am I considered an ‘it girl?’ Because I’m in a lot of movies right now or am on the covers of magazines? I just hope there is something solid behind that. Because here’s the thing with ‘it girl’ status. It’s great and amazing that anybody is saying that at all. But how long does that last?;Amanda Seyfried;hope
36403;At a time of such hope and optimism in the Middle East, we cannot let the Libyan government violate every principle of international law and human rights with impunity.;William Hague;hope

36412;My hope is that 10 years from now, after I’ve been across the street at work for a while, they’ll all be glad they gave me that wonderful vote.;Sandra Day O’Connor;hope
36413;I don’t think I’m a great songwriter, but I think I’ve learned a lot about it, and I don’t think there’s any one way to do it. I don’t think I can control it at all. I can just kind of hope that it happens.;Norah Jones;hope
36414;I hope there are some audiophiles still out there.;Norah Jones;hope
36415;You always hear people saying, ‘I hope I’m not turning into my dad’, but I’d be honoured if I became half as decent a bloke as he is.;Johnny Vegas;hope
36416;Before you give up hope, turn back and read the attacks that were made on Lincoln.;Bruce Barton;hope
36417;My hope was that organizations would start including this range of skills in their training programs - in other words, offer an adult education in social and emotional intelligence.;Daniel Goleman;hope
36418;I hope I live long enough to see every hungry school child in the world being fed under the so-called McGovern-Dole program.;George McGovern;hope

36421;The only way of knowing a person is to love them without hope.;Walter Benjamin;hope

36423;I think it’s a mistake to ever look for hope outside of one’s self.;Arthur Miller;hope
36424;Hope can be the most wonderful thing in the world or it can crush your heart like an eggshell.;Harlan Coben;hope
36425;I am very lucky that I get to tell stories for a living. I love being able to grab people’s attention, to keep them turning the pages, to make them stay awake all night. I want to stir the pulse, yes, but also to stir the heart. I hope ‘The Woods’ does that.;Harlan Coben;hope
36426;I hope in my lifetime we can all continue to laugh at ourselves and not put down anyone for what they weigh.;Richard Simmons;hope

36428;Hope is independent of the apparatus of logic.;Norman Cousins;hope
36429;With optimism, you look upon the sunny side of things. People say, ‘Studs, you’re an optimist.’ I never said I was an optimist. I have hope because what’s the alternative to hope? Despair? If you have despair, you might as well put your head in the oven.;Studs Terkel;hope
36430;We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

Purged of both hope and fear, we find courage in the face of helplessness, insignificance and uncertainty.;Jonathan Sacks;hope
36431;I am inclined to attach some importance to the new system of manufacturing and venture to throw it out with the hope of its receiving a full discussion among those who are most interestedin the subject.;Charles Babbage;hope
