      <a href="/2020/02/08/17131" class="pagination--pager" title="I Know You Care’ is really personal and fragile for me. For me, it’s about losing a family member and also about a breakup. It’s about this idea of losing someone for good.;Ellie Goulding;family 20786;Getting and keeping my immunity became very important to me. For I needed to take care of myself and my family. No one else was worried about me.;Monica Lewinsky;family 20787;I was the black sheep of the family, and my mother never really understood me.;Andre Rieu;family 20788;Of course, I will continue to share my favorite Southern recipes, just like my mama, grandmother and family shared with me over the years. And now, I’ll be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes.;Paula Deen;family 20789;What we’ve tried to do is have neighbors, colleagues, friends and family talking.;David Plouffe;family 20790;Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live.;Hans-Georg Gadamer;family 20791;Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, brain and spinal cord disorders, diabetes, cancer, at least 58 diseases could potentially be cured through stem cell research, diseases that touch every family in America and in the world.;Rosa DeLauro;family 20792;When you go to the movies with your whole family, it’s a different experience. For some reason, it’s something that you’re all doing together and you take away something special in that.;Vin Diesel;family 20793;I was the oldest of the children in my family. I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making. I was taking my little sister to ballet, picking up my brother, sort of being a super-nanny.;Vin Diesel;family 20794;And having a strong family, you know we’ve lost some members of our family and had some setbacks, but I think a good family and kids all those things I thought at one time… you got to be kidding me… Those things are so important they enable you to go on.;Brett Favre;family 20795;Well family is obviously the most important. There was a time when I thought football was the most important.;Brett Favre;family 20796;In spite of reports about playing with various teams, I’m enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football.;Brett Favre;family 20797;I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I’m the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I’m not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I’m just relaxing and enjoying it.;Betty White;family 20798;It’s a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That’s why it’s a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.;Betty White;family 20799;I’m thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.;Nicki Minaj;family 20800;When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that’s what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.;Leighton Meester;family 20801;My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don’t like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I’m not Nicki Minaj when I’m with them.;Nicki Minaj;family 20802;What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don’t write the book where it’s a conspiracy reaching the prime minister I don’t write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.;Harlan Coben;family 20803;A racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family.;Saul Alinsky;family 20804;Frankly I’m fairly boring or fairly busy. Between writing and family, I have little time for anything else.;Harlan Coben;family 20805;If I’m not writing well, I’m not happy. If I’m not spending enough time with my family, I’m not happy. If I’m not connecting to friends or if I don’t work out enough… You get the point. Everything has to be balanced. Nothing should be an extreme.;Harlan Coben;family 20806;I always wanted to be a farmer. There is a tradition of that in my family.;Bjork;family 20807;The Royal family to me are not England, and they are not the flag.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20808;My family, although they’re very large on both my parents’ sides, they don’t know much about their family tree. Occasionally, they try to dig, but they can’t get very far, and it’s baffling. In Dublin, it seems that so many public records were wiped out it’s proven to be very difficult, so I know very little.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20809;Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.;Heath Ledger;family 20810;I’m not sure why no one wants to admit there’s a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.;Tyler Perry;family 20811;Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20812;Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20813;Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20814;We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20815;I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry, because I don’t think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made, but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family 20816;No journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where I live. I don’t parade my family out for display, which is the way it will stay.;Tom Hanks;family 20817;I’ve always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I’d put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.;Emma Roberts;family 20818;We fight a lot, you know, but that’s family. We may be dysfunctional but we’re still family.;Star Jones;family 20819;I like all the families in the U.K. But what I like about the idea of the royal family is… they seem like they’re well educated and there’s something admirable about them. And the Queen… she reminds me of my grandma.;will.i.am;family 20820;I’m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I’ve been.;Tom Hardy;family 20821;If you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your family’s life but change your ghetto’s life, make your ghetto a good neighbourhood, learn science try to be like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.;will.i.am;family 20822;If you live in a good neighborhood, you drive home and there’s a bank. There’s grocery stores and big houses - but no motels. What that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house.;will.i.am;family 20823;Respectable means rich, and decent means poor.
