D. Jakes;forgiveness 24182;I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior. I believe that Jesus died for my sins, and rose again, and that’s my belief. I still don’t know what ‘Christian’ means.

24361;If you’re not ready to die for it, put the word ‘freedom’ out of your vocabulary.;Malcolm X;freedom
24362;When freedom does not have a purpose, when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women, when it does not listen to the voice of conscience, it turns against humanity and society.;Pope John Paul II;freedom
24363;There is only one kind of freedom and that’s individual liberty. Our lives come from our creator and our liberty comes from our creator. It has nothing to do with government granting it.;Ron Paul;freedom

24366;I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom.;Simone de Beauvoir;freedom
24367;How absurd men are! They never use the liberties they have, they demand those they do not have. They have freedom of thought, they demand freedom of speech.;Soren Kierkegaard;freedom
24368;For more than four decades, the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant - Moammar Gaddafi.

24376;Freedom isn’t free. It shouldn’t be a bragging point that ‘Oh, I don’t get involved in politics,’ as if that makes someone cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn’t insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable.;Bill Maher;freedom
24377;Our plans protect freedom and opportunity, and our blueprint is the Constitution of the United States.;Mitt Romney;freedom
24378;Freedom has cost too much blood and agony to be relinquished at the cheap price of rhetoric.;Thomas Sowell;freedom
