It was an education in group dynamic. I came out of there with a master’s degree in comedy.;Matt LeBlanc;education 16506;About half my work in education is U.S. political reform around school districts and charter schools, and creating more room for entrepreneurial organizations to develop. And about half on technology, which I look at as a global platform.;Reed Hastings;education 16507;What’s got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education 16508;Competitiveness is really what it costs you per man-hour to get you what you want. In other words, there’s an education level that plays into the mix and so if it’s inexpensive to buy an hour of real good education in places like China versus the U.S., that factors in.;Ray Dalio;education 16509;I was really fortunate growing up to have a broad musical education. My parents listened to all kinds of music, rock, soul, Motown, jazz, Frank Sinatra, everything.;Mayer Hawthorne;education 16510;A liberal education… frees a man from the prison-house of his class, race, time, place, background, family and even his nation.;Robert M. Hutchins;education 16511;Many thousands of youth have been deprived of the benefit of education thereby, their morals ruined, and talents irretrievably lost to society, for want of cultivation: while two parties have been idly contending who should bestow it.;Joseph Lancaster;education 16512;When I enrolled in college at age 19, I had a total of eight years of formal classroom education. As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.;Philip Emeagwali;education 16513;I believe that access to a university education should be based on the ability to learn, not what people can afford. I think there is no more nauseating a sight than politicians pulling up the ladder of opportunity behind them.;Charles Kennedy;education 16514;I want to see far more decisions taken far closer to the patients, the passengers and the pupils. Far more power for locally and regionally elected politicians who understand best the needs of their areas. And far more say too for the dedicated staff at all levels in health and education.;Charles Kennedy;education 16515;Further Education should be about the ability to learn, not the ability to pay - everyone who is able should have the opportunity, regardless of their family background. I don’t want to see students struggling with huge debts or frightened off even going to university in the first place.;Charles Kennedy;education 16516;But I like going to church. If you’ve been brought up in the Church of England, it feels like visiting an elderly relative. And I think it’s important that part of the kids’ education is knowing about the Bible.;Jack Dee;education 16517;A good education is usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head.;Agnes de Mille;education 16518;In Mexico, theater is very underground, so if you’re a theater actor it’s very difficult to make a living. But it’s also a very beautiful pathway to knowledge and to an open education.;Gael Garcia Bernal;education 16519;I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have.;George J. Mitchell;education 16520;I don’t want to scrounge around and be homeless, and I want to finish my education.;Callan McAuliffe;education 16521;It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current.

A thousand voices call to us on every hand, but our ears are stopped with wisdom.;Jean Giraudoux;education 16523;At any rate, girls are differently situated. Having no need of deep scientific knowledge, their education is confined more to the ordinary things of the world, the study of the fine arts, and of the manners and dispositions of people.;William John Wills;education 16524;Making the City Of Joy gave me the best political education of my life. It became a wrestling match between an Englishman who had gradually ceased to be a Marxist, and a culture that was becoming more Marxist by the day.;Roland Joffe;education 16525;In my home State of Louisiana, several institutions of higher education have been impacted by both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, literally dozens across the entire State.;Bobby Jindal;education 16526;Poorer students take out larger loans and will have to contribute more to the cost of higher education.;Anne Campbell;education 16527;There is still a lot of misinformation being spread about higher education funding arrangements under the new Act. The students page on my website sets out the main points in the Act.;Anne Campbell;education 16528;Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can’t use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.;Bjorn Lomborg;education 16529;And really, the basis, I think, of achieving some success in what I want to do today comes from my mother’s push to get me to read and to make something of myself from the standpoint of an education.;Sam Donaldson;education 16530;The amount of money we spend on education is important, but not nearly as important as how the money is spent.;Bob Riley;education 16531;Ladies and gentlemen: There can be no greater investment in Alabama’s future than an investment in education.;Bob Riley;education 16532;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;education 16533;The Obama administration now has regulations that tells them that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life. They can no longer even teach abstinence education. They have to be neutral with respect to how people behave.;Rick Santorum;education 16534;I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.;Kamala Harris;education 16535;Each year, I say I’m going to go to school next year. It’s inevitable that I’ll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education 16536;Illegal immigration is crisis for our country. It is an open door for drugs, criminals, and potential terrorists to enter our country. It is straining our economy, adding costs to our judicial, healthcare, and education systems.;Timothy Murphy;education 16537;For this reason, to study English literature without some general knowledge of the relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave one’s literary education very incomplete.;Lafcadio Hearn;education 16538;The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.;Liberty Hyde Bailey;education 16539;There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.;Marvin Hamlisch;education 16540;Interactions between fathers and children are the starting point of education.;Yoshihiko Noda;education 16541;In our post-9/11 world, our Nation’s military deserves, at least the same access to institutions of higher education that any other major employer might enjoy.;Mike Rogers;education 16542;I’m sure everything has a bearing on what I’m doing. My family is a lower-middle-class family, there’s lots of children, seven brothers, two sisters grew up together, fighting with each other, went to school. My mother went to school up to 4th grade. My father went to school up to 8th grade.

Castle;education 16566;By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N.

And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education 16570;What we’re doing now is we’re saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what’s truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we’re taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16571;Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education 16572;The big shift in approach on education that we are taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education 16573;The one thing we can do is invest in the quality of education, especially higher education.;Ron Kind;education 16574;I also found that for myself, since I’ve had no religious education, it was so interesting to see the different versions of heaven and what life on earth means.;Barbara Walters;education 16575;The present structure of rewards in high schools produces a response on the part of an adolescent social system which effectively impedes the process of education.;James S.

So, I promise you, every day, I am going to talk about jobs, spending, and education.;Meg Whitman;education 16579;It’s commonly said that people who’ve been ill in childhood and who’ve had an upset education never really regret that they do. It means that you don’t look at the world in the way that other people do, and if you were inclined to be a writer, that’s a help.;John Keegan;education 16580;I think we spend too much on K-12 education a.k.a. teachers’ salaries.

We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education 16623;I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an actor. I never even thought about other careers. The acting field is certainly not the path many Indian parents encourage their children to take, but mine were very supportive.

But it’s the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don’t have it.;Edward James Olmos;education 16629;Universal suffrage should rest upon universal education.

With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education 16631;I am less disposed to think of a West Point education as requisite for this business than I was at first. Good sense and energy are the qualities required.;Rutherford B.

Lack of education does not cause terrorism.;John O. Brennan;education 16641;You look at public education system, charter schools, infrastructure, in so many ways New Orleans has come back stronger.;Drew Brees;education 16642;I came up poor.

I graduated from high school in 1965. So becoming active was almost a rite of passage.;Danny Glover;education 16645;It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program.

Similar to Main Street America.;Henry Bonilla;education 16653;And I thought that was the best way for me to participate, because standing in the crowd and listening is a fantastic education, but it’s not my nature.

I found it dull and I preferred to cause chaos and have fun. I regret this massively now.;Dominic Cooper;education 16658;The people in Iraq lived essentially good lives.
