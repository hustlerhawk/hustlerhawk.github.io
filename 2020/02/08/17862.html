<hr />

<p>Howard the Duck!’ That’s a really interesting movie. I appreciate my career, because I’ve had a lot of very interesting ups and downs, and most people… That movie is such a famous flop. In a land of a lot of flops, it’s kind of awesome to be in a really famous flop. I mean, it’s kind of a poster child for flops.;Lea Thompson;famous
21605;Going to New York to do whatever - show business - it just seemed fun. It seemed fun to go to the big city and meet all kinds of different people and maybe be famous. It was just exciting. So I wasn’t scared.;January Jones;famous
21606;At each of these northern posts there were interesting experiences in store for me, as one who had read all the books of northern travel and dreamed for half a lifetime of the north and that was - almost daily meeting with famous men.;Ernest Thompson Seton;famous
21607;Right now I’m the most famous silent movie actress in the world and I want to keep that for me. So I hope there’s not going to be any other silent movies.;Berenice Bejo;famous
21608;If somebody tells me I’m famous I say, ‘I’m not.’ I can’t see myself as famous and I don’t think I’ll ever call myself famous. I definitely don’t feel famous.;Shayne Ward;famous
21609;OK, so I’m not famous for the right reasons.;William Hung;famous
21610;I’m the guy that made Joe DiMaggio famous.;Lefty Gomez;famous
21611;It’s weird to have people so interested in your personal life. It’s a part of the business that grosses me out. I’m always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they’re also famous, and they can’t live their life.;Andy Samberg;famous
21612;So I’m a young boy in the 1940s growing up, seeing Ralph Bunche on a regular basis, seeing Duke Ellington on a regular basis. We know that these people are famous. They’re living in the same community as we live in. They go to the same stores and shops.;Ed Smith;famous
21613;When I came to New York, I began to meet the people who became the most famous artists of our time. I was insecure about my own level of ability, I didn’t know whether I could compete with these people and, at the same time. I was wondering what is this anyway?;Henry Flynt;famous
21614;People seldom become famous for what they say until after they are famous for what they’ve done.;Cullen Hightower;famous
21615;And my marriage was perfect when I wasn’t famous.;Damon Wayans;famous
21616;I never thought about being famous.;Damon Wayans;famous
21617;I’m famous for being nicer to my fans than anyone on the face of the Earth because I figure a) They pay my salary, and b) It’s probably like a big moment in your life to meet somebody so I would say, just come on up.;James Woods;famous
21618;I always regarded people who want fame with a lot of suspicion. Unless you have a product to sell, I don’t know why anyone would want to be famous. I can’t imagine what need that would fill.;Jessica Cutler;famous
21619;Some people with blogs are never going to get famous, and they’ve been doing it for, like, over a year. I feel bad for them.;Jessica Cutler;famous
21620;I’ve always been successful. Now I’m famous and successful.;Chazz Palminteri;famous
21621;Being very famous is not the fun it sounds. It merely means you’re being chased by a lot of people and you lose your privacy.;Colin Wilson;famous
21622;I’m famous by default. I came out of the womb, and people wanted to know who I was because of my parents.;Frances Bean Cobain;famous
21623;All I say is that I don’t go out with famous men.;Samantha Mumba;famous
21624;I didn’t set out to be famous if I’d wanted that, I would have gone on ‘Big Brother.</p>
