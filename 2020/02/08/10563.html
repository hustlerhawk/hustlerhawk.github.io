      <a href="/2020/02/08/10564" class="pagination--pager" title="I Know You Care’ is about my dad. And I haven’t seen him for a long, long time. And my parents divorced when I was really young. And I guess I just wanted a - it was my way of saying that I wasn’t bitter or angry anymore. I was just sad and just felt like something was missing.;Ellie Goulding;dad 12392;My father came from a very poor background, but I was very fortunate in the sense that we were never in need. My dad was determined to make sure that we didn’t want for things. He wanted to give us more opportunity than he had, a better shot at a better life.;Brad Pitt;dad 12393;Since I was a boy, from this house, I was out rescuing crocodiles and snakes. My mum and dad were very passionate about that and, I was lucky enough to go along.;Steve Irwin;dad 12394;My mother and dad were big animal lovers, too. I just don’t know how I would have lived without animals around me. I’m fascinated by them - both domestic pets and the wild community. They just are the most interesting things in the world to me, and it’s made such a difference in my lifetime.;Betty White;dad 12395;During the Depression, my dad made radios to sell to make extra money. Nobody had any money to buy the radios, so he would trade them for dogs. He built kennels in the backyard, and he cared for the dogs.;Betty White;dad 12396;Losing my parents was the most crushing thing that ever happened to me. I lost my dad when I was 26, and it changed my life entirely.;Harlan Coben;dad 12397;My father was the quintessential husband and dad.;Sidney Poitier;dad 12398;My mother taught public school, went to Harvard and then got her master’s there and taught fifth and sixth grade in a public school. My dad had a more working-class lifestyle. He didn’t go to college. He was an auto mechanic and a bartender and a janitor at Harvard.;Ben Affleck;dad 12399;I was always a kid trying to make a buck. I borrowed a dollar from my dad, went to the penny candy store, bought a dollar’s worth of candy, set up my booth, and sold candy for five cents apiece. Ate half my inventory, made $2.50, gave my dad back his dollar.;Guy Fieri;dad 12400;Come Christmas Eve, we usually go to my mom and dad’s. Everybody brings one gift and then we play that game when we all steal it from each other. Some are really cool, others are useful and some are a bit out there.;Amy Grant;dad 12401;I was born and raised in East Los Angeles by a single mom who had three biological kids and adopted four more. I never met my dad.;will.i.am;dad 12402;I didn’t know my Dad - he moved out early. And my mom’s politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn’t think about Democrats or Republicans. She thought about who made sense. I’ve been both in my life.;Dennis Miller;dad 12403;My dad was a labourer and my mum had exactly the same job as Noel Gallagher’s mum - she was a dinner lady at our local school. Everyone comes over from Ireland and they get the same jobs.;Danny Boyle;dad 12404;I think my dad has helped me tremendously.;Rand Paul;dad 12405;My dad was dean of fine arts at the university. I was casting bronzes in the school foundry. I was using the university as a playground.;Maya Lin;dad 12406;My dad didn’t drive - the only dad I knew who didn’t.;Julie Burchill;dad 12407;When I moved out of London 13 years ago, I found a whole other reason not to drive. This was because my new husband Dan, unlike my dad, did drive, and this became a great source of fun and adventure.;Julie Burchill;dad 12408;And I love Mel Brooks. My Dad loved his movies, too, they’re awesome, the kind of thing that if you’re in for ten minutes, you’re in for two hours.;Mike Myers;dad 12409;One of the things I like about when I tour sometimes is that occasionally you’ll see a dad there with his 12-year-old son and they’re both enjoying it.;Tim Vine;dad 12410;Yes, I always remember my dad’s, mom’s and my grandma’s perfumes.;Marc Jacobs;dad 12411;Becoming a dad was the proudest moment of my life. Playing football does not even compare.;Wayne Rooney;dad 12412;I’ve never been a hands-on dad. I’m not ashamed to admit it, but you can’t run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.;Gordon Ramsay;dad 12413;I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God’s sake, not a television personality.;Gordon Ramsay;dad 12414;I was always embarrassed because my dad wore a suit and my mother wore flat pumps and a cozy jumper while my friends’ parents were punks or hippies.;Shirley Manson;dad 12415;You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad. They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing.;Leonardo DiCaprio;dad 12416;Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families. Families who stay up on Sunday nights pacing the floor, like my dad did, while their children, tucked in bed, dream big dreams. Families who aren’t sure what Monday morning will bring, but who believe our nation’s best days are still ahead.;Charles Schumer;dad 12417;I would have to say the person with whom I am most in love is definitely my son, Everly Bear. Although I’m his dad, I’m also his friend.;Anthony Kiedis;dad 12418;My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn’t know my dad very well. He and my mother split up after the war. I was raised by my maternal grandmother and grandfather, and by my mother.;Al Pacino;dad 12419;My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did.;Gwen Stefani;dad 12420;But I honestly don’t read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can’t hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.;Fiona Apple;dad 12421;My dad was a Communist Party member who fought for his country.;Tim Roth;dad 12422;Paul McCartney had a baby when he was 61 Rod Stewart was 66 Rupert Murdoch was a stunning 72. Not only does that mean they’ll have less stamina than the average dad, that means they’ll, well, check out a lot sooner too.;Jeffrey Kluger;dad 12423;The golden child may be the oldest one, unless it’s the youngest. It may be the toughest one, unless it’s the most sensitive. It’s not even necessary that Mom and Dad have the same favorite - and typically they don’t.;Jeffrey Kluger;dad 12424;My dad spent his whole life getting into fights for telling what he believed to be the truth. Basically it comes from my dad-and he’s screaming right-wing, so there you are.;Thom Yorke;dad 12425;When my dad divorced my mom it was kind of like him leaving me also.;Nicole Richie;dad 12426;No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren’t cool, just to establish themselves. That’s what adolescence is about. They’re gonna go through that no matter what.;Eddie Vedder;dad 12427;I think the hardest thing about making music now is being a great dad at the same time. There’s an insanity that goes with writing - a mad scientist thing that you have to go through - and sacrificing a kid’s upbringing to do that is not an option.;Eddie Vedder;dad 12428;My dad gave me my first bike at 16. I soon fell off and was in a wheelchair for weeks. I haven’t fallen since.;Hugh Laurie;dad 12429;My dad always said he couldn’t remember a time when I did not want to act.;Gwyneth Paltrow;dad 12430;My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother’s into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.;Michael Sheen;dad 12431;I was always okay with the fact that I was taller and bigger than everybody else growing up. My mom, my dad, and my friends always told me I was beautiful.;Jordin Sparks;dad 12432;If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I’m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.;Katherine Jenkins;dad 12433;In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I’ve been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.;Katherine Jenkins;dad 12434;I was a very sickly kid.

I’m very grateful to my mum and dad for adopting me - they’re completely incredible people. It was my dad who encouraged me to question everything, to forge my own path, to think, to read. I always felt it was my right to question everything.;Dan Stevens;dad 12436;My dad was a mime and then he had his company and created plays for children and was very successful with it.;Marion Cotillard;dad 12437;My dad is the nicest guy you’ll ever meet, and the easiest going.;Serena Williams;dad 12438;My dad is a marketing mastermind.;Serena Williams;dad 12439;I grew up in Chicago, so I’ve always been a Bears fan.

My daughter gets very upset if I shave and says, ‘Bring back the spikes, Dad.
