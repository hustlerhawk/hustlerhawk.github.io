Just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesn’t mean that they are a harmless little bunny.;Colin Hanks;funny 26607;There have been times when I felt suicidal and I would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because I thought there’d be something I’d miss that was funny in the future. If there’s a chance I’m going to laugh tomorrow then want to live to experience that.;Dave Navarro;funny 26608;And remember, it’s also very funny, because side by side with grief lies joy.;Fran Drescher;funny 26609;I liked getting the best villain award. I thought that was funny.;Stephen Dorff;funny 26610;The music industry is really funny, when you have a hit record, everyone knows who are you, everyone wants to do duets with you, then if you have a miss, people suffer from amnesia.;Seal;funny 26611;This is funny because I just had a job over the summer for VH1, a project I did called Strange Frequency where I got to play a Goth rock band singer.;Charisma Carpenter;funny 26612;I mean, I’m married first of all to one of, if not the most wonderful women in the world. She is everything - funny, attractive, hard-working, she has integrity, she loves me to bits.;Seal;funny 26613;A film that I love is ‘Raising Arizona’ and that’s funny but it’s quite indie and weird and odd and quirky. I’d love to do something like that. Who knows?;Stephen Moyer;funny 26614;And of course Marc Cherry heightens it and makes it hilarious. But there’s so many universal themes in the show, and he made it so funny. We knew he was onto something if he could keep it up and, thankfully, he did.;James Denton;funny 26615;It’s so funny when you’re actually directing because things start popping that you don’t expect to pop, and something that you think is going to pop, maybe doesn’t quite have the impetus that you thought it might.;Stephen Moyer;funny 26616;Well, I’m not afraid to say something if I think it’s funny, even if it’s harsh or racist.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26617;The promos with all of the beautiful women probably attracted some men, but the mystery story line is pretty cool. It’s got that dark edge, and people will watch anything funny.;James Denton;funny 26618;But I think you can make fun of anything as long as it’s funny enough.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26619;It’s funny, because ‘1600 Penn’ was the first time I really started to read the reviews, because I am an executive producer and I wanted to see what people were enjoying and not enjoying as a means to an end, right?;Josh Gad;funny 26620;I mean, I talk about being Jewish a lot. It’s funny because I do think of myself as Jewish ethnically, but I’m not religious at all. I have no religion.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26621;It’s funny because ‘The Book of Mormon’ is ‘The Book of Mormon’ now. When I was doing it at the very beginning, and I was a part of it for four years and always believed in it, I never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for ‘South Park’ fans.;Josh Gad;funny 26622;I know people will think it’s funny because I’ve done glamour modelling in the past, but I felt embarrassed about my body and just wanted to cover it up.;Jennifer Ellison;funny 26623;I got the wake-up call that no one is policing our oceans. I wondered, how can I do anything? What really can I do to make things better? There are some perks to being a celebrity. My job is to be funny once in a while, but it’s my responsibility to make good use of it.;Angela Kinsey;funny 26624;My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles were all funny, and I felt that energy, that delivery, that timing, that sarcasm. All that stuff seeped into my brain.;Jeff Ross;funny 26625;Wikipedia is just an incredible thing. It is fact-encirclingly huge, and it is idiosyncratic, careful, messy, funny, shocking and full of simmering controversies - and it is free, and it is fast.;Nicholson Baker;funny 26626;I don’t write literary fiction - I write books that are entertaining, but are also, I hope, well-constructed and thoughtful and funny and have things to say about men and women and families and children and life in America today.;Jennifer Weiner;funny 26627;Do you want me to apologize after every joke? If it doesn’t offend somebody it’s probably not a joke. It’s probably an observation that’s not funny. It’s gotta offend somebody somewhere.;Jeff Ross;funny 26628;Billy Tauzin is one of the most interesting people in Washington. He is smart, funny, and interesting.;Tucker Carlson;funny 26629;I’ve actually tried to roast somebody that I don’t like, and it doesn’t go well. Either they’re a bad sport or I’m not as funny as I could be.;Jeff Ross;funny 26630;My parents are both very funny but they’re also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I’m just a lunatic. I don’t know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I’m just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It’s not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.;Emma Stone;funny 26631;It’s funny, though, because when I first started going to races after we met, I was extremely nervous. It’s like being backstage and hoping you don’t trip over something or break an amp or accidentally speak into a live microphone, so I was really hesitant.;Ashley Judd;funny 26632;People are funny, and in the most tragic situations, when comedy erupts from nowhere, it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute. You’re laughing one minute and you’re crying the next and that’s just life for me, and that is what people are like.;Sally Hawkins;funny 26633;So it was just funny to read a script that was just similar to what had been going on in my life.;Piper Perabo;funny 26634;When we criticize in Iran the actions of the government, the fundamentalists say that we and the Bush Administration are in the same camp. The funny thing is that human rights activists and Mr. Bush can never be situated in the same group.;Shirin Ebadi;funny 26635;I have a funny family, but none of them are remotely in show business.;Wanda Sykes;funny 26636;It is funny because the guy who is my boss now, Howard Stern, has a similarity there. He got big being a regular guy. He wasn’t the greatest looking guy in the world.;Artie Lange;funny 26637;But I think funny and talent will always win out I mean, of course there are hurdles, but I think if you’re funny you will get over all of that.;Wanda Sykes;funny 26638;The last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic, blonde actress with the funny voice.;Joey Lauren Adams;funny 26639;The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.;Winston Churchill;future 26640;Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.;Oscar Wilde;future 26641;Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards.

Just because they are the shy guy in the corner doesn’t mean that they are a harmless little bunny.;Colin Hanks;funny 26607;There have been times when I felt suicidal and I would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because I thought there’d be something I’d miss that was funny in the future. If there’s a chance I’m going to laugh tomorrow then want to live to experience that.;Dave Navarro;funny 26608;And remember, it’s also very funny, because side by side with grief lies joy.;Fran Drescher;funny 26609;I liked getting the best villain award. I thought that was funny.;Stephen Dorff;funny 26610;The music industry is really funny, when you have a hit record, everyone knows who are you, everyone wants to do duets with you, then if you have a miss, people suffer from amnesia.;Seal;funny 26611;This is funny because I just had a job over the summer for VH1, a project I did called Strange Frequency where I got to play a Goth rock band singer.;Charisma Carpenter;funny 26612;I mean, I’m married first of all to one of, if not the most wonderful women in the world. She is everything - funny, attractive, hard-working, she has integrity, she loves me to bits.;Seal;funny 26613;A film that I love is ‘Raising Arizona’ and that’s funny but it’s quite indie and weird and odd and quirky. I’d love to do something like that. Who knows?;Stephen Moyer;funny 26614;And of course Marc Cherry heightens it and makes it hilarious. But there’s so many universal themes in the show, and he made it so funny. We knew he was onto something if he could keep it up and, thankfully, he did.;James Denton;funny 26615;It’s so funny when you’re actually directing because things start popping that you don’t expect to pop, and something that you think is going to pop, maybe doesn’t quite have the impetus that you thought it might.;Stephen Moyer;funny 26616;Well, I’m not afraid to say something if I think it’s funny, even if it’s harsh or racist.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26617;The promos with all of the beautiful women probably attracted some men, but the mystery story line is pretty cool. It’s got that dark edge, and people will watch anything funny.;James Denton;funny 26618;But I think you can make fun of anything as long as it’s funny enough.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26619;It’s funny, because ‘1600 Penn’ was the first time I really started to read the reviews, because I am an executive producer and I wanted to see what people were enjoying and not enjoying as a means to an end, right?;Josh Gad;funny 26620;I mean, I talk about being Jewish a lot. It’s funny because I do think of myself as Jewish ethnically, but I’m not religious at all. I have no religion.;Sarah Silverman;funny 26621;It’s funny because ‘The Book of Mormon’ is ‘The Book of Mormon’ now. When I was doing it at the very beginning, and I was a part of it for four years and always believed in it, I never really knew if it was going to be more than a convention for ‘South Park’ fans.;Josh Gad;funny 26622;I know people will think it’s funny because I’ve done glamour modelling in the past, but I felt embarrassed about my body and just wanted to cover it up.;Jennifer Ellison;funny 26623;I got the wake-up call that no one is policing our oceans. I wondered, how can I do anything? What really can I do to make things better? There are some perks to being a celebrity. My job is to be funny once in a while, but it’s my responsibility to make good use of it.;Angela Kinsey;funny 26624;My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles were all funny, and I felt that energy, that delivery, that timing, that sarcasm. All that stuff seeped into my brain.;Jeff Ross;funny 26625;Wikipedia is just an incredible thing. It is fact-encirclingly huge, and it is idiosyncratic, careful, messy, funny, shocking and full of simmering controversies - and it is free, and it is fast.;Nicholson Baker;funny 26626;I don’t write literary fiction - I write books that are entertaining, but are also, I hope, well-constructed and thoughtful and funny and have things to say about men and women and families and children and life in America today.;Jennifer Weiner;funny 26627;Do you want me to apologize after every joke? If it doesn’t offend somebody it’s probably not a joke. It’s probably an observation that’s not funny. It’s gotta offend somebody somewhere.;Jeff Ross;funny 26628;Billy Tauzin is one of the most interesting people in Washington. He is smart, funny, and interesting.;Tucker Carlson;funny 26629;I’ve actually tried to roast somebody that I don’t like, and it doesn’t go well. Either they’re a bad sport or I’m not as funny as I could be.;Jeff Ross;funny 26630;My parents are both very funny but they’re also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I’m just a lunatic. I don’t know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I’m just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It’s not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.;Emma Stone;funny 26631;It’s funny, though, because when I first started going to races after we met, I was extremely nervous. It’s like being backstage and hoping you don’t trip over something or break an amp or accidentally speak into a live microphone, so I was really hesitant.;Ashley Judd;funny 26632;People are funny, and in the most tragic situations, when comedy erupts from nowhere, it can turn on its head within the space of a second or a minute. You’re laughing one minute and you’re crying the next and that’s just life for me, and that is what people are like.;Sally Hawkins;funny 26633;So it was just funny to read a script that was just similar to what had been going on in my life.;Piper Perabo;funny 26634;When we criticize in Iran the actions of the government, the fundamentalists say that we and the Bush Administration are in the same camp. The funny thing is that human rights activists and Mr. Bush can never be situated in the same group.;Shirin Ebadi;funny 26635;I have a funny family, but none of them are remotely in show business.;Wanda Sykes;funny 26636;It is funny because the guy who is my boss now, Howard Stern, has a similarity there. He got big being a regular guy. He wasn’t the greatest looking guy in the world.;Artie Lange;funny 26637;But I think funny and talent will always win out I mean, of course there are hurdles, but I think if you’re funny you will get over all of that.;Wanda Sykes;funny 26638;The last person they expected to connect with a screenplay was the comedic, blonde actress with the funny voice.;Joey Lauren Adams;funny 26639;The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.;Winston Churchill;future 26640;Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.;Oscar Wilde;future 26641;Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.;Steve Jobs;future 26642;I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.;Albert Einstein;future 26643;It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.;William Shakespeare;future 26644;The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.;Albert Einstein;future 26645;You can’t connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.;Steve Jobs;future 26646;The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. You realize that you control your own destiny.;Albert Ellis;future 26647;If we open a quarrel between past and present, we shall find that we have lost the future.;Winston Churchill;future 26648;Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else’s hands, but not you.;Jim Rohn;future 26649;Every man gotta right to decide his own destiny.;Bob Marley;future 26650;I do not want to foresee the future. I am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.;Mahatma Gandhi;future 26651;In this bright future you can’t forget your past.;Bob Marley;future 26652;Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.;Malcolm X;future 26653;For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.;John F. Kennedy;future 26654;Stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.;Wayne Dyer;future 26655;It looks like the future’s really bright.;Michael P. Anderson;future 26656;I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, ‘No, I won’t do it, I won’t behave his way anymore. I’m lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,’ and then you do it.;Leo Buscaglia;future 26657;The future starts today, not tomorrow.;Pope John Paul II;future 26658;What matters is to live in the present, live now, for every moment is now. It is your thoughts and acts of the moment that create your future. The outline of your future path already exists, for you created its pattern by your past.;Sai Baba;future 26659;Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.;William Jennings Bryan;future 26660;Study the past, if you would divine the future.;Confucius;future 26661;Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.;George Orwell;future 26662;I don’t think the human mind can comprehend the past and the future. They are both just illusions that can manipulate you into thinking theres some kind of change.;Bob Dylan;future 26663;I just don’t want to live like I used to. And at some point, I’m going to put a gag order on myself in terms of talking about the past. I’ve got to slam the door and deal with the present and the future.;Charlie Sheen;future 26664;Life is divided into three terms - that which was, which is, and which will be. Let us learn from the past to profit by the present, and from the present, to live better in the future.;William Wordsworth;future 26665;A dream is your creative vision for your life in the future. You must break out of your current comfort zone and become comfortable with the unfamiliar and the unknown.;Denis Waitley;future 26666;God wants us to prosper financially, to have plenty of money, to fulfill the destiny He has laid out for us.;Joel Osteen;future 26667;The future ain’t what it used to be.;Yogi Berra;future 26668;There’s no present. There’s only the immediate future and the recent past.;George Carlin;future 26669;Destiny has two ways of crushing us - by refusing our wishes and by fulfilling them.;Henri Frederic Amiel;future 26670;Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.;Marcus Aurelius;future 26671;I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.;Patrick Henry;future 26672;Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future.;Nelson Mandela;future 26673;On every front there are clear answers out there that can make this country stronger, but we’re going to break through the fear and the frustration people are feeling.
