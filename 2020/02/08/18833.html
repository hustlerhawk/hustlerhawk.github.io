My philosophic belief that ultimately being true to yourself is liberating, with every individual’s inalienable right to be who they are without fear or recrimination.;Corey Hart;fear 22673;Fear is the enemy.

The answer to that question will determine whether the society is a free society or a fear society.;Natan Sharansky;fear 22683;Amin knew that neither West nor East would criticize him for fear that he would support the other side.

Maybe it’s the fear of getting in an elevator maybe it’s the fear of going on a plane and seeing the world.;Criss Angel;fear 22691;I approach my character with the question: What would an animal think? How would an animal respond? A lot of times, it’s quick action and no fear, and sometimes it’s irrational fear. You don’t always know.;Victoria Pratt;fear 22692;I think that the problem is that people fear so many things and they don’t live life to its fullest. And for me as an artist, if God should want me to come this Wednesday to the end of my life, so be it.;Criss Angel;fear 22693;You can’t be afraid to put out a fire if you’re a fireman. You can’t be afraid to be a police officer and carry a gun if you’re afraid to get up and go out there. So you’ve got to put that fear to the side and go out in faith to overcome that.;Duane Chapman;fear 22694;Of all the hazards, fear is the worst.;Sam Snead;fear 22695;I don’t buy into any of that hogwash.

S. Haldane;fear 22704;Don’t fear anything for your letters, they are burnt one by one and I hope you do the same with mine.;Camille Claudel;fear 22705;I think interviews can be fine.

Politics is knowing when to pull the trigger.;Mario Puzo;finance 22787;Canadians know that the promise of a recession didn’t happen because of anything we did here.

So until the Internet becomes our source of entertainment - and watch it, I believe it will - this is how things go.;Nathan Fillion;finance 22804;I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers. For example, athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education.;Angela Merkel;finance 22805;The FHA’s success provides strong evidence that government can and should play a role in the nation’s mortgage finance system.

We think there’s a good case for doing it now. We want to do it in an overall fiscally responsible way.;Timothy Geithner;finance 22821;Finance is critical. If sufficient investment is made in infrastructure and venture capital is made available, there will be a big improvement in the situation.;Sanjay Kumar;finance 22822;Now both my films have been number one at the Australian box office and it took about two years just to get the finance for this film, so if it’s hard for me then God help everyone else.;Yahoo Serious;finance 22823;Three years after starting, by physically doing everything from raising the finance to special effects, we’d finally cobbled together our low budget film.;Yahoo Serious;finance 22824;I know what I don’t know.

It was quite an enlightened sort of move. You could go to this government bureau with scripts and and get finance for films.;Bruce Beresford;finance 22833;I’ve learned there’s a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short-seller.

Its deliberative powers are paralyzed.;John Rawls;finance 22844;We’ll have a public power authority, which will also have the ability to build power or finance power.

The answer to that question will determine whether the society is a free society or a fear society.;Natan Sharansky;fear 22683;Amin knew that neither West nor East would criticize him for fear that he would support the other side.

We give our best.;Rickie Lee Jones;fear 22689;People feel uncomfortable talking about racial issues out of fear that if they express things, they will be characterized in a way that’s not fair. I think that there is still a need for a dialogue about things racial that we’ve not engaged in.;Eric Holder;fear 22690;One of the most gratifying things I get as an artist is when people watch me do these different demonstrations, and they in some way feel empowered by what I’m doing so they can confront their own fears. Maybe it’s the fear of getting in an elevator maybe it’s the fear of going on a plane and seeing the world.;Criss Angel;fear 22691;I approach my character with the question: What would an animal think? How would an animal respond? A lot of times, it’s quick action and no fear, and sometimes it’s irrational fear.

And for me as an artist, if God should want me to come this Wednesday to the end of my life, so be it.;Criss Angel;fear 22693;You can’t be afraid to put out a fire if you’re a fireman. You can’t be afraid to be a police officer and carry a gun if you’re afraid to get up and go out there.

It’s just a fear of not knowing what women have that’s so powerful. It’s this shield they put up to try to get closer.;K. D. Lang;fear 22702;Greatness comes from fear. Fear can either shut us down and we go home, or we fight through it.;Lionel Richie;fear 22703;I think, however, that so long as our present economic and national systems continue, scientific research has little to fear.;John B.

The real excitement is playing the game.;Donald Trump;finance 22717;Inflation is taxation without legislation.;Milton Friedman;finance 22718;Under capitalism, man exploits man.

And in finance too.;Evan Davis;finance 22792;I have come close to producing films. But generally by the time they hit the screen, there's about 50 people with producer credits, so what's the point. I usually find scripts I like with no money attached and take them to producers that I know and try to raise finance.;Tim Roth;finance 22793;I worked with a group of people who argued day and night - professors, officials, the Minister of Finance - but there were decisions that I had to make.;Shimon Peres;finance 22794;My real adversary has no name, no face, no party. It will never be elected, yet it governs - the adversary is the world of finance.;Francois Hollande;finance 22795;My adversary is the world of finance.;Francois Hollande;finance 22796;I don't want euro bonds that serve to mutualize the entire debt of the countries in the euro zone.

Let's call them 'project bonds' instead of euro bonds.;Francois Hollande;finance 22797;One of the things that's great about New York is that it is not a one-industry town.

If you have the money to do it on your own, by yourself, and you have a TV network, you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is, art needs finance. That's how this industry works. So until the Internet becomes our source of entertainment - and watch it, I believe it will - this is how things go.;Nathan Fillion;finance 22804;I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers.

We think there's a good case for doing it now. We want to do it in an overall fiscally responsible way.;Timothy Geithner;finance 22821;Finance is critical. If sufficient investment is made in infrastructure and venture capital is made available, there will be a big improvement in the situation.;Sanjay Kumar;finance 22822;Now both my films have been number one at the Australian box office and it took about two years just to get the finance for this film, so if it's hard for me then God help everyone else.;Yahoo Serious;finance 22823;Three years after starting, by physically doing everything from raising the finance to special effects, we'd finally cobbled together our low budget film.;Yahoo Serious;finance 22824;I know what I don't know.

It was quite an enlightened sort of move. You could go to this government bureau with scripts and and get finance for films.;Bruce Beresford;finance 22833;I've learned there's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short-seller.

The rest of the country should be happy that we are what we are.;David Dinkins;finance 22841;Unfortunately, money in politics is an insidious thing - and a loophole in our campaign finance system was taken advantage of with money going to existing or new 527 groups with the sole purpose of influencing the election.;Olympia Snowe;finance 22842;We were told this war would be over in a matter of weeks, and that the Iraqis would be able to finance it with oil sales. We were promised it was not a mission of nation building.;Sherrod Brown;finance 22843;In constant pursuit of money to finance campaigns, the political system is simply unable to function. Its deliberative powers are paralyzed.;John Rawls;finance 22844;We'll have a public power authority, which will also have the ability to build power or finance power.
