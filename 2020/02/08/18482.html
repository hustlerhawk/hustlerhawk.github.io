<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>Freedom from fear’ could be said to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights.;Dag Hammarskjold;fear 22245;I have always been aware that you have to get people listening before you can change their minds. Any artist’s big fear is being ignored, so if you get debate, that’s great.;Damien Hirst;fear 22246;A book is the only place in which you can examine a fragile thought without breaking it, or explore an explosive idea without fear it will go off in your face. It is one of the few havens remaining where a man’s mind can get both provocation and privacy.;Edward P. Morgan;fear 22247;I spoke without fear of contradiction. I simply did not suffer self-doubt.;Elia Kazan;fear 22248;I’ve probably earned the right to screw up a few times. I don’t want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.;Emma Watson;fear 22249;There’s an honesty in our family - my kids and I are able to talk about things without me putting the fear of God into them.;Billie Joe Armstrong;fear 22250;Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.;Samuel Ullman;fear 22251;When I have a camera in my hand, I know no fear.;Alfred Eisenstaedt;fear 22252;There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in life as fear.;Jawaharlal Nehru;fear 22253;Fear is the mother of foresight.;Thomas Hardy;fear 22254;The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.;Adam Smith;fear 22255;Greed, like the love of comfort, is a kind of fear.;Cyril Connolly;fear 22256;He who doesn’t fear death dies only once.;Giovanni Falcone;fear 22257;The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;fear 22258;One of the scary things is that, when you’re a kid, you look at your dad as the man who has no fear. When you’re an adult, you realize your father had fear, and that you have it, too.;David Duchovny;fear 22259;The fear factor actually brings the genuineness.;Ang Lee;fear 22260;In politics, what begins in fear usually ends in failure.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;fear 22261;I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that’s my one fear: that everything has happened nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again… the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul.;J. G. Ballard;fear 22262;I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free.;LL Cool J;fear 22263;A star on a movie set is like a time bomb. That bomb has got to be defused so people can approach it without fear.;Jack Nicholson;fear 22264;My whole life I’ve had the fear that I was going to be abandoned.;Halle Berry;fear 22265;I think one of the terrible things today is that people have this deathly fear of food: fear of eggs, say, or fear of butter. Most doctors feel that you can have a little bit of everything.;Julia Child;fear 22266;I won’t allow myself to have tremendous fear.;Calvin Klein;fear 22267;Any fear of aging, I think, is simply vanity.;Leighton Meester;fear 22268;Mysticism and exaggeration go together. A mystic must not fear ridicule if he is to push all the way to the limits of humility or the limits of delight.;Milan Kundera;fear 22269;I fear God and next to God I mostly fear them that fear him not.;Saadi;fear 22270;Some people need to stay at the top. They are afraid to re-start from zero because they fear the critics.;Eric Cantona;fear 22271;There is no greater hell than to be a prisoner of fear.;Ben Jonson;fear 22272;As long as enough people can be frightened, then all people can be ruled. That is how it works in a democratic system and mass fear becomes the ticket to destroy rights across the board.;James Bovard;fear 22273;My biggest fear in life is to be forgotten.;Evita Peron;fear 22274;We all have that burning question about what happens if we lose somebody we love, especially if we lose them tragically. We wonder what fear was going on, we wonder if we could have reached out and touched them, held their hand, looked in their eyes, been there.;Kevin Costner;fear 22275;To withdraw is not to run away, and to stay is no wise action, when there’s more reason to fear than to hope.;Miguel de Cervantes;fear 22276;I fear no man, no beast or evil, brother.;Hulk Hogan;fear 22277;Courage is a special kind of knowledge: the knowledge of how to fear what ought to be feared and how not to fear what ought not to be feared.;David Ben-Gurion;fear 22278;A merchant who approaches business with the idea of serving the public well has nothing to fear from the competition.;James Cash Penney;fear 22279;You can ask me pretty much anything. There’ll be things I’ll go, ‘That feels a little too personal.’ But most things I don’t have a fear of being asked about.;Nicole Kidman;fear 22280;You cannot avoid war in life, you cannot avoid the fear of terrorism, you cannot avoid those things now, they are a part of everyday demeanor.;John Mayer;fear 22281;Fame does lead to money, which I don’t have a close relationship with. I’m the kind of guy who never sees the money - it all goes somewhere else. I don’t understand it, I don’t like to deal with it. I have a fear of not having it, because I grew up without it.;David Duchovny;fear 22282;I had a fear that I’d be typecast, but I don’t really have that fear anymore.;David Duchovny;fear 22283;Whenever somebody says they need an angle for their story I always fear that they’ve got an idea and they want me to fit into it or they want me to come up with an idea myself or I’m supposed to be more revealing than I’ve been, and to me it just sounds like something I don’t want to do.;David Duchovny;fear 22284;Fear is a very explosive emotion, but it has a short life span. It’s the sprint. The marathon is hope.;Mike Huckabee;fear 22285;The record company’s worst fear is that you’ll fall in love or get rich.;Maynard James Keenan;fear 22286;I’m very much afraid of being mad - that’s my one fear.;Sting;fear 22287;He who does not fear death cares naught for threats.;Pierre Corneille;fear 22288;Fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family, the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality. Fear leads them to ask, if we cannot trust the Bible, what can we trust?;Garrett Hardin;fear 22289;I woke up full of hate and fear the day before the most recent peace march in San Francisco. This was disappointing: I’d hoped to wake up feeling somewhere between Virginia Woolf and Wavy Gravy.;Anne Lamott;fear 22290;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;fear 22291;I have a big fear of change, or negative change, anyway. I’m basically the same person I was when I won ‘Idol,’ or when I was 10.;Kelly Clarkson;fear 22292;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It’s perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;fear 22293;I was taught that to create anything you had to believe in failure, simply because you had to be prepared to go through an idea without any fear. Failure, you learned, as I did in art school, to be a wonderful thing. It allowed you to get up in the morning and take the pillow off your head.;Malcolm Mclaren;fear 22294;We must travel in the direction of our fear.;John Berryman;fear 22295;I have a tendency to sabotage relationships I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts.;Michael Buble;fear 22296;Fear attracts attack.;Edwin Louis Cole;fear 22297;Fear of things invisible in the natural seed of that which everyone in himself calleth religion.;Thomas Hobbes;fear 22298;I try to get in quiet time and book time, but really, the only time I ever get that is when I’m on an airplane - I have a fear of flying, but I actually love flying because it’s the only time I can sleep, and it’s the only time I get to read.;Kesha;fear 22299;I define fear as standing across the ring from Joe Louis and knowing he wants to go home early.;Max Baer;fear 22300;Business is war. I go out there, I want to kill the competitors. I want to make their lives miserable. I want to steal their market share. I want them to fear me and I want everyone on my team thinking we’re going to win.;Kevin O’Leary;fear 22301;Fear is not a good teacher. The lessons of fear are quickly forgotten.;Mary Catherine Bateson;fear 22302;I had to confront my fears and master my every demonic thought about inferiority, insecurity, or the fear of being black, young, and gifted in this Western culture.;Lauryn Hill;fear 22303;Let us go forth with fear and courage and rage to save the world.;Grace Paley;fear 22304;My main concern with the condition of mathematics in high school is that there’s a lot of fear involved! Math is not, generally speaking, presented in a fun way. The concepts, as I see them, are fun, and that’s the way I’d like to convey them myself.;Danica McKellar;fear 22305;You always fear when you’re making a movie that has a moral to the story that people are going to reject the idea of being taught a lesson.;Christina Ricci;fear 22306;Curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will.;James Stephens;fear 22307;When I’m acting, I’m two beings. There’s the one monitoring the distance between myself and the camera, making sure I hit my marks, and there is the one driven by this inner fire, this delicious fear.;Jeanne Moreau;fear 22308;Shock, confusion, fear, anger, grief, and defiance. On Sept. 11, 2001, and for the three days following the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, President George W. Bush led with raw emotion that reflected the public’s whipsawing stages of acceptance.;Ron Fournier;fear 22309;We, the people. Manifest Destiny. Conceived in liberty. Fear itself. Ask not. Morning in America. United we stand. Yes, we can. In times of great change and tumult, presidents seek to inspire beleaguered Americans by reminding them of their national identity.;Ron Fournier;fear 22310;Eighty percent of all choices are based on fear. Most people don’t choose what they want they choose what they think is safe.;Phil McGraw;fear 22311;Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason’s imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work.;Louis Aragon;fear 22312;We tell lies when we are afraid… afraid of what we don’t know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing that we fear grows stronger.;Tad Williams;fear 22313;Man’s loneliness is but his fear of life.;Eugene O’Neill;fear 22314;I think I’m a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking. It’s not about being shameful, I’m just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing, and it probably started at age 15. I can be around people and say what I think without fear.;Kristen Stewart;fear 22315;I may be compelled to face danger, but never fear it, and while our soldiers can stand and fight, I can stand and feed and nurse them.;Clara Barton;fear 22316;When you advise any person you should be guided by the fear of God.;Abu Bakr;fear 22317;God helps those who fear Him.;Abu Bakr;fear 22318;Grief has limits, whereas apprehension has none. For we grieve only for what we know has happened, but we fear all that possibly may happen.;Pliny the Elder;fear 22319;It’s better to get mugged than to live a life of fear.;Freeman Dyson;fear 22320;Dictators and oppressors should continue to fear me because I will be here for a long time.;Lech Walesa;fear 22321;When the entertainers of the Right aren’t declaring their disgust with President Obama for groveling before foreign potentates, they’re pretending to fear him as a left-wing thug, an exemplar of what they call ‘the Chicago way. - Hustler Hawk</title>

Most people don’t choose what they want they choose what they think is safe.;Phil McGraw;fear 22311;Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason’s imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work.;Louis Aragon;fear 22312;We tell lies when we are afraid… afraid of what we don’t know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing that we fear grows stronger.;Tad Williams;fear 22313;Man’s loneliness is but his fear of life.;Eugene O’Neill;fear 22314;I think I’m a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking.
