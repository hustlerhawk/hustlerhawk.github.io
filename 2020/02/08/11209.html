I gotta leave it alone.;Harry Connick, Jr.;alone 1258;I was a queen, and you took away my crown a wife, and you killed my husband a mother, and you deprived me of my children. My blood alone remains: take it, but do not make me suffer long.;Marie Antoinette;alone 1259;I just don’t want to die alone, that’s all. That’s not too much to ask for, is it It would be nice to have someone care about me, for who I am, not about my wallet.;Richard Pryor;alone 1260;There is no end of craving.

Women have to feel like they are not alone.;Salma Hayek;alone 1329;Victims always feel alone and helpless.;Deepak Chopra;alone 1330;It is a great mystery that though the human heart longs for Truth, in which alone it finds liberation and delight, the first reaction of human beings to Truth is one of hostility and fear!;Anthony de Mello;alone 1331;To have striven, to have made the effort, to have been true to certain ideals - this alone is worth the struggle.;William Osler;alone 1332;I’m learning a lot about myself being alone, and doing what I’m doing.;Chantal Kreviazuk;alone 1333;It’s time to end the cruel slaughter of whales and leave these magnificent creatures alone.;Paul McCartney;alone 1334;God created man and, finding him not sufficiently alone, gave him a companion to make him feel his solitude more keenly.;Paul Valery;alone 1335;When you stand alone and sell yourself, you can’t please everyone.

They were done on the quick, and some of that stuff was made on wire, not even tape, let alone digital.;Keith Richards;alone 1345;Golf… is the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone, with the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball where it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well.;P. G. Wodehouse;alone 1346;Talent alone won’t make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: ‘Are your ready?
