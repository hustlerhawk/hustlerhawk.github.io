It’s what they want.;George Lucas;inspirational 38193;Rap music’s been around for too long now to be inspirational. The words are, but the music isn’t.;Alexander McQueen;inspirational 38194;I wanted to do something inspirational for my children.;Harvey Weinstein;inspirational 38195;I try not to put anything political on the forefront of what I’m trying to do creatively. At the same time, I do think it’s wonderful when I hear people say that it’s inspirational that I’m an Indian woman on camera. My life is very diverse, and my friends are a diverse group of people.;Mindy Kaling;inspirational 38196;I do love to eavesdrop. It’s inspirational, not only for subject matter but for actual dialogue, the way people talk.;Lynda Barry;inspirational 38197;I view art as an inspirational tool.;Thomas Kincade;inspirational 38198;To me, the Seventies were very inspirational and very influential… With my whole persona as Snoop Dogg, as a person, as a rapper.

You can do that any time you please - not that it’s not a good inspirational tactic for the people that it works for.;Brittany Murphy;inspirational 38202;Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It’s part ballet. It’s part battleground, part playground.

I found it so inspirational. Why not make myself cooler than I am?;Stephen Colbert;inspirational 38207;President Obama called for a ‘we’ nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes.

And that’s what we need most in our country today.;Anna Deavere Smith;inspirational 38208;Had I not come out with an inspirational CD, you perhaps would have never known that I feel like I feel, that all songs, all the music I’ve ever done is a gift from God.;Smokey Robinson;inspirational 38209;You never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea. Travel is very inspirational - but it’s in the ordinary that I find my themes of love and work and family.;Adriana Trigiani;inspirational 38210;I will always desire to play with Bruce Springsteen.

Kelly;inspirational 38212;When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical.

Higgins;inspirational 38218;Architecture is not an inspirational business, it’s a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things that’s all.;Harry Seidler;inspirational 38219;In fact, I wouldn’t really call this a Gospel album, I call it more an inspirational album.;Smokey Robinson;inspirational 38220;I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn’t read poetry, so if I hadn’t had the chance to experience it at school I’d never have experienced it. But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.;Carol Ann Duffy;inspirational 38221;Since we launched the original ‘Pop Idol’ in England, I’ve remained close with Simon Fuller.
