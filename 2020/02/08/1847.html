<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>The Dance Scene’ is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don’t realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You’re not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I’m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it’s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing 2426;I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders.

We call it Host in Peril quite often, because people love to see me risk my life or be in danger.;Rick Mercer;amazing 2429;My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you’re 13 and you think you’re too cool for your parents. When you’re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing 2430;I guess winning an Oscar is the ultimate dream. A lot of amazing actors go their whole career without even being nominated. So that would definitely be a goal to reach.

He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up.

Then I did a movie called Company Men, a little comedy about the Bay of Pigs.;Sigourney Weaver;amazing 2440;I wore my first pair of Louboutins during this press tour. It was absolutely amazing, they weren’t heels, they were little shoes, but they were velvet and they were blue.;Chloe Moretz;amazing 2441;I jetset around and play these songs and get to hang with some pretty amazing people, then I go home to a really great farm, though actually it’s a disaster area of a farm at the moment. But it’s certainly a blast. I wouldn’t trade lives with anyone right now.;Brad Paisley;amazing 2442;It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.;Giancarlo Esposito;amazing 2443;So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.;Uma Thurman;amazing 2444;My sister, she’s amazing.

I had a great family, a typical family with drama in certain areas, and that’s pretty much everywhere in everyone’s life.;Tina Yothers;amazing 2450;It’s nice because success has allowed me to have a blast on stage, to be in the studio with amazing people, but I find it all a bit bizarre.;David Guetta;amazing 2451;It’s amazing what we can get away with and what we can’t. But it’s not for me to decide.;Mike Judge;amazing 2452;I feel fortunate I have this amazing relationship with so many people in America, because I was in their homes at a very private time of day. They probably might have still had their robe on and their slippers and haven’t made the beds.;Joan Lunden;amazing 2453;Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing 2454;Isn’t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing 2455;I have experienced some amazing food!

They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That’s one of the most amazing things.;Mark Goddard;amazing 2459;You know, it’s amazing. I don’t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I’ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;amazing 2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him. And I have the most amazing job, with writing that any actor would love and costars who I can’t wait to see on Monday mornings. And I love coming home to my husband.;Julianna Margulies;amazing 2461;Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes.

I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.;Giuliana Rancic;amazing 2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type ‘chokeholds’ and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out.

Wilson;amazing 2467;That show, ‘The Amazing Race’ - is that about white people?;Zach Galifianakis;amazing 2468;Each of us have things and thoughts and descriptions of an amazing universe in our possession that kings in the 17th Century would have gone to war to possess.;Kary Mullis;amazing 2469;With ‘The Host,’ I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I’d love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing… Matt Damon has some very Jared-esque qualities, and then Casey Affleck as Ian and Ben Affleck as Kyle. Imagine the interplay.;Stephenie Meyer;amazing 2470;It’s amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you’re on the street, begging.;Paz de la Huerta;amazing 2471;I mean, there is amazing amount of oil and gas and other resources out beneath the sea. It’s staggering.;Robert Ballard;amazing 2472;I grew up in a Christian home with amazing parents.;Allyson Felix;amazing 2473;When you’re offered things, it makes it so much easier to be indecisive. And it’s silly because you can pass on some really amazing things.;Alicia Silverstone;amazing 2474;It was amazing to watch him in the darkroom at an advanced age, still get excited when the results were pleasing.

Sometimes it didn’t come out the way you wanted, but it was good.;Chris LeDoux;amazing 2482;Elle MacPherson is absolutely amazing she is just so beautiful.;Carol Alt;amazing 2483;There is something about the South that accepts the supernatural. If you don’t accept it and you’re having a conversation with someone who does, it’s just one of those polite things where you don’t question their belief in ghosts. You just go, ‘Oh, yeah, okay.’ It’s amazing to be able to have conversations like that.;Alice Englert;amazing 2484;I filmed ‘Albatross’ before I got ‘Downton.’ It’s a coming-of-age movie about this girl who leaps into this family’s life, like a whirlwind.

It’s amazing to me that we let humans drive cars… It’s a bug that cars were invented before computers.;Eric Schmidt;amazing 2490;We start ‘The Butler’ in June and that’s incredibly exciting for me because I get to work with the amazing Forest Whitaker again.

She’s amazing.;Jenna Ushkowitz;amazing 2498;Anyone who has played the game professionally, you’re always taught that the ball is the most important, most precious thing, so when the ball hits the ground, it’s always a mad scramble. It’s amazing how many times there is a fumble, and the person who recovers it initially doesn’t walk away with the ball.;Barry Sanders;amazing 2499;For me, I don’t expect to have a really amazing meal each time I dine out. Having a good meal with your loved ones - that’s what makes the experience.;Wolfgang Puck;amazing 2500;As an actor, to have achieved financial stability is amazing. But I always have this weird fear that I’m not going to get any more work it’s about not having enough money.;Paul Giamatti;amazing 2501;The thing is, I don’t believe in most of what’s done. The amount of financial and imaginative energy that’s put into mediocrity is just amazing which I find to be fundamentally offensive as a human being.;William Hurt;amazing 2502;I knew I’d just done one of the most amazing things that I will ever get a chance to do.

If you don’t, it’s whatever you think it is.;Reggie Watts;amazing 2521;I’m from the Madeleine L’Engle school.

I don’t know man. It’s amazing.;T-Pain;amazing 2524;Brains don’t really smell, but what’s amazing about the brain is that it’s almost like scrambled eggs or soft tofu, almost like a gel.

I feel so guilty.;Nikki Reed;amazing 2535;When we’d suggested doing it, the Theatre Royal management had said, ‘Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.’ As it happened, every single ticket was booked for every single performance, and this confirmation that our judgment was right was sweet.

That is an amazing leap, is it not?;Dennis Potter;amazing 2541;Giving birth was the most amazing thing I’ve ever done.

I guess the theater sat 2,700 people every night so it was an amazing experience.;Blair Underwood;amazing 2560;I think Paul Newman had an amazing career. I also love what Tom Hanks has done.

He has found a way to make blockbusters that are about something and that is what I want to do.;Josh Duhamel;amazing 2561;I’m always going to get more of a charge playing Chicago than I will Duluth or some place like that.

It depends on what I’m going through in my life but I’m a huge fan of Bjork. Sometimes I get so emotional because she’s so amazing.;Ashlee Simpson;amazing 2571;I have amazing people around me.

It can be a long journey. There’s the ticket prices. But when the music goes to the community - not the community coming to the concert - they say, ‘Wow!

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="The Dance Scene’ is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don’t realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You’re not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I’m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it’s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing 2426;I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders. He brings different elements to the game that many people would not even realize, and to watch and witness a superior talent like him and watch him prepare and train, and study the game is truly amazing.;Emmitt Smith;amazing 2427;Birdie is amazing and such an incredible child and I’m having such a great time being a mom but I still want to have a career and I still look forward to auditions and parts, and when I don’t get them I’m disappointed.;Busy Philipps;amazing 2428;I get to do the most amazing things. We call it Host in Peril quite often, because people love to see me risk my life or be in danger.;Rick Mercer;amazing 2429;My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you’re 13 and you think you’re too cool for your parents. When you’re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing 2430;I guess winning an Oscar is the ultimate dream. A lot of amazing actors go their whole career without even being nominated. So that would definitely be a goal to reach. It’s a difficult one, but I’m aiming for it!;Taylor Lautner;amazing 2431;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2432;It’s pretty amazing being me.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2433;Let me tell you, Barack Obama is the most down dude in the world, but he’s so smart so articulate, such an amazing speaker such a passionate man. He’s humble.;Marlon Wayans;amazing 2434;It’s amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations.

He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping, but they might see the most amazing outfit and think, ‘When am I going to wear that?’, so it’s my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;amazing 2438;I have an amazing relationship with food.;Katharine McPhee;amazing 2439;I’ve been very fortunate to be able to jump around.

Then I did a movie called Company Men, a little comedy about the Bay of Pigs.;Sigourney Weaver;amazing 2440;I wore my first pair of Louboutins during this press tour. It was absolutely amazing, they weren’t heels, they were little shoes, but they were velvet and they were blue.;Chloe Moretz;amazing 2441;I jetset around and play these songs and get to hang with some pretty amazing people, then I go home to a really great farm, though actually it’s a disaster area of a farm at the moment. But it’s certainly a blast. I wouldn’t trade lives with anyone right now.;Brad Paisley;amazing 2442;It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.;Giancarlo Esposito;amazing 2443;So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.;Uma Thurman;amazing 2444;My sister, she’s amazing.

I had a great family, a typical family with drama in certain areas, and that’s pretty much everywhere in everyone’s life.;Tina Yothers;amazing 2450;It’s nice because success has allowed me to have a blast on stage, to be in the studio with amazing people, but I find it all a bit bizarre.;David Guetta;amazing 2451;It’s amazing what we can get away with and what we can’t. But it’s not for me to decide.;Mike Judge;amazing 2452;I feel fortunate I have this amazing relationship with so many people in America, because I was in their homes at a very private time of day. They probably might have still had their robe on and their slippers and haven’t made the beds.;Joan Lunden;amazing 2453;Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing 2454;Isn’t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing 2455;I have experienced some amazing food! Yet when I think about the most luxurious and exquisite meals I have had, visions of simple food made from a few natural ingredients are what most excite me.;Mark Hyman;amazing 2456;I love to go shopping at Target. They have so much stuff there, you can buy almost anything, it’s really amazing.;Liv Tyler;amazing 2457;Growing up, I looked up to major league baseball players, and now these young women have amazing, incredible women all across the board, from swimming to gymnastics to softball to basketball.;Jennie Finch;amazing 2458;One thing that is almost always said to me is, I grew up with you. They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That’s one of the most amazing things.;Mark Goddard;amazing 2459;You know, it’s amazing. I don’t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I’ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;amazing 2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him. And I have the most amazing job, with writing that any actor would love and costars who I can’t wait to see on Monday mornings. And I love coming home to my husband.;Julianna Margulies;amazing 2461;Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes. I was eight and I was like, Wow, I wanna do that!;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2462;I don’t want to wake up and not truly be enjoying my life and these amazing things around me.;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2463;But one of the amazing things about documentary is that you can remake it every time you make one. There is no rule about how a documentary film has to be made.;Errol Morris;amazing 2464;In fact, it is amazing how much European films - Italian, French, German and English - have recovered a certain territory of the audience in their countries over the last few years.;Wim Wenders;amazing 2465;I’m from Naples. I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt like it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.;Giuliana Rancic;amazing 2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type ‘chokeholds’ and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out.

Wilson;amazing 2467;That show, ‘The Amazing Race’ - is that about white people?;Zach Galifianakis;amazing 2468;Each of us have things and thoughts and descriptions of an amazing universe in our possession that kings in the 17th Century would have gone to war to possess.;Kary Mullis;amazing 2469;With ‘The Host,’ I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I’d love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing… Matt Damon has some very Jared-esque qualities, and then Casey Affleck as Ian and Ben Affleck as Kyle. Imagine the interplay.;Stephenie Meyer;amazing 2470;It’s amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you’re on the street, begging.;Paz de la Huerta;amazing 2471;I mean, there is amazing amount of oil and gas and other resources out beneath the sea. It’s staggering.;Robert Ballard;amazing 2472;I grew up in a Christian home with amazing parents.;Allyson Felix;amazing 2473;When you’re offered things, it makes it so much easier to be indecisive. And it’s silly because you can pass on some really amazing things.;Alicia Silverstone;amazing 2474;It was amazing to watch him in the darkroom at an advanced age, still get excited when the results were pleasing.

Amazing how often that’s forgotten.;Stephen Hunter;amazing 2495;I’m on an Isabel Marant kick.

She’s amazing.;Jenna Ushkowitz;amazing 2498;Anyone who has played the game professionally, you’re always taught that the ball is the most important, most precious thing, so when the ball hits the ground, it’s always a mad scramble. It’s amazing how many times there is a fumble, and the person who recovers it initially doesn’t walk away with the ball.;Barry Sanders;amazing 2499;For me, I don’t expect to have a really amazing meal each time I dine out. Having a good meal with your loved ones - that’s what makes the experience.;Wolfgang Puck;amazing 2500;As an actor, to have achieved financial stability is amazing. But I always have this weird fear that I’m not going to get any more work it’s about not having enough money.;Paul Giamatti;amazing 2501;The thing is, I don’t believe in most of what’s done. The amount of financial and imaginative energy that’s put into mediocrity is just amazing which I find to be fundamentally offensive as a human being.;William Hurt;amazing 2502;I knew I’d just done one of the most amazing things that I will ever get a chance to do.

If you don’t, it’s whatever you think it is.;Reggie Watts;amazing 2521;I’m from the Madeleine L’Engle school.

The symmetry of nature, the structure and order of it.;Tom Shadyac;amazing 2522;I don’t think immortality is necessarily the key to understanding the world.

I don’t know man. It’s amazing.;T-Pain;amazing 2524;Brains don’t really smell, but what’s amazing about the brain is that it’s almost like scrambled eggs or soft tofu, almost like a gel.

I’ll love that guy to the end of time.;Corin Nemec;amazing 2530;No matter how loud the stadium is, once you’re on that field and that offense walks up to the line, it’s silent.

I feel so guilty.;Nikki Reed;amazing 2535;When we’d suggested doing it, the Theatre Royal management had said, ‘Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.’ As it happened, every single ticket was booked for every single performance, and this confirmation that our judgment was right was sweet.

You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don't realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited.

He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up.

That's the most amazing thing about time.;Ozwald Boateng;amazing 2552;That's an amazing feeling, to walk onstage, and you're not thinking about anything, you're not thinking about your lines or what you're supposed to do - your body, your brain knows, so there's freedom.

I guess the theater sat 2,700 people every night so it was an amazing experience.;Blair Underwood;amazing 2560;I think Paul Newman had an amazing career. I also love what Tom Hanks has done.

It depends on what I'm going through in my life but I'm a huge fan of Bjork. Sometimes I get so emotional because she's so amazing.;Ashlee Simpson;amazing 2571;I have amazing people around me.

2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I’m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it’s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing

2438;I have an amazing relationship with food.;Katharine McPhee;amazing

2454;Isn’t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing

2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him.

2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type ‘chokeholds’ and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out.

2482;Elle MacPherson is absolutely amazing she is just so beautiful.;Carol Alt;amazing
2483;There is something about the South that accepts the supernatural.

2484;I filmed ‘Albatross’ before I got ‘Downton.’ It’s a coming-of-age movie about this girl who leaps into this family’s life, like a whirlwind. She’s ballsy and brash and wonderful, it was such an amazing character to play.;Jessica Brown Findlay;amazing

2494;If you have only 95 minutes of material, make an only 95-minute movie. Amazing how often that’s forgotten.;Stephen Hunter;amazing
2495;I’m on an Isabel Marant kick. She does an amazing job of making things that are everyday-wearable but also special and a little bit different. I definitely like that she has a ’70s western vibe. There’s something that’s very fun and vintage in what she’s doing.;Jennifer Morrison;amazing

2497;Watching Bernadette Peters perform is like an acting class. She’s amazing.;Jenna Ushkowitz;amazing
2498;Anyone who has played the game professionally, you’re always taught that the ball is the most important, most precious thing, so when the ball hits the ground, it’s always a mad scramble.

2520;If you pay attention to the world, it’s an amazing place. If you don’t, it’s whatever you think it is.;Reggie Watts;amazing
2521;I’m from the Madeleine L’Engle school. The more she delves into science, the more she knows there’s a creator who’s behind these amazing laws, these amazing events. The symmetry of nature, the structure and order of it.;Tom Shadyac;amazing
2522;I don’t think immortality is necessarily the key to understanding the world. You have to be careful with what you think you’re achieving. I’m all for science discovering amazing and fantastic things about our world, but I think the motivations behind it are slightly askew.;Reggie Watts;amazing
2523;The way that people show me love on Twitter? I don’t know man. It’s amazing.;T-Pain;amazing

2535;When we’d suggested doing it, the Theatre Royal management had said, ‘Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.’ As it happened, every single ticket was booked for every single performance, and this confirmation that our judgment was right was sweet.

2539;Well, I’ve always thought that my career was in England, really. I used to do more in the theatre, and I felt that I should be there. It’s not far is it? It’s amazing the way that special FX have taken a quantum leap in what they’re capable of doing.;Albert Finney;amazing
2540;The strangest thing that human speech and human writing can do is create a metaphor. That is an amazing leap, is it not?;Dennis Potter;amazing
2541;Giving birth was the most amazing thing I’ve ever done.

I didn’t want doctors. I had a midwife.;Carolyn Murphy;amazing
2542;I always say, I’m certain I changed ‘Watchmen’ less than the Coen brothers changed ‘No Country for Old Men.’ I’m certain of it. But you don’t hear the Cormac McCarthy fans, like, up in arms about it. They should be. It’s like an amazing Pulitzer Prize-winning book.;Zack Snyder;amazing

2550;The real amazing thing about all of this is I think I’ve maintained the mentality of a musician throughout it all, which I’m proudest of. And I’m still playing on people’s records and singing on people’s records.;Vince Gill;amazing

2559;Two packed houses. I guess the theater sat 2,700 people every night so it was an amazing experience.;Blair Underwood;amazing

2561;I’m always going to get more of a charge playing Chicago than I will Duluth or some place like that.

2562;I know so many amazing actors who don’t get work… and then there are a bunch of real duds that work all the time. The industry is just not fair in that way.;Jenna Fischer;amazing

2575;I have a great family, I live an amazing life.;John Oates;amazing
2576;It really lasted the whole game, because I was really untouchable, unstoppable that game.

2577;Recently, I went to a disco with friends, and all the young people were saying, ‘Dudamel, we want to go to your concert, but it’s impossible because it’s sold out.’ It’s really amazing.;Gustavo Dudamel;amazing
2578;Going to a concert can sometimes be very difficult. It can be a long journey. There’s the ticket prices. But when the music goes to the community - not the community coming to the concert - they say, ‘Wow! I didn’t know that this music was so amazing!</p>
