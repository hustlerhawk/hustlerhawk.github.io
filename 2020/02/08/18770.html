I wasn’t getting the Nicole Kidman roles.;Joey Lauren Adams;amazing 2720;The Academy Awards was an amazing night. I know I kind of lost my mind a little bit. I apologize for that. That night went so fast I can’t remember what I said or what happened.;Cuba Gooding, Jr.;amazing 2721;It’s pretty amazing to me that my first hit record was an Elvis Presley record.;Mac Davis;amazing 2722;It’s great that in the German language I’ve sold almost 30 million books. Isn’t that amazing?;Ken Follet;amazing 2723;I think women are amazing and women’s friendships are like a sisterhood and we should see more of it in television and film.;Laurie Holden;amazing 2724;It’s just amazing to do something that’s part of a pop culture phenomenon.;Chaske Spencer;amazing 2725;I just want to work forever. I absolutely love what I’m doing. I learn all the time from all these amazing artists.;Juno Temple;amazing 2726;You know, Johnny Depp has always been a massive inspiration for me and he’s somebody who has produced an incredible amount of work, and every single piece that he does is amazing.;Jamie Campbell Bower;amazing 2727;There’s such an array of brilliant roles for young women. You read all these amazing young women going through different stages in their life - different stages, different fascinations, different textualities, different friendships.;Juno Temple;amazing 2728;I just did a part in ‘Sin City 2.’ I got to do a scene with Ray Liotta. Amazing man, extraordinary gentleman who was just so kind to me… I’m so excited about that I think it’s gonna be very cool.;Juno Temple;amazing 2729;The thing that’s tricky is sometimes the best voices - just because someone hits the big notes and sounds amazing - it doesn’t necessarily mean they make the greatest artists.;Kara DioGuardi;amazing 2730;I love MySpace it’s done an amazing job for me and it’s been insane over the past couple of weeks, but I’m not a poster girl for them.;Lily Allen;amazing 2731;Actually, we got signed in November of 2000 with Dreamworks which is the most amazing label. We have friends on other labels and though we are not selling millions of records, yet, they treat us with tons of respect and give us some very good guidance.;Adam Rich;amazing 2732;I liked the way they treated the first, second, and third place finishers equally. It was an amazing year. I only entered two song contests this year I won one and placed second in the other. And I entered each of them a day or two before the deadline.;Arthur Godfrey;amazing 2733;Winning ‘The Apprentice’ changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. It has been an amazing experience working for Donald Trump and I am very grateful for the whole opportunity.;Bill Rancic;amazing 2734;It’s amazing how everyone has an opinion on how you should live your life.;Sherry Stringfield;amazing 2735;The racing driver’s mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex.

It was amazing to me that I got nominated for an Academy Award.;Sally Kellerman;amazing 2737;It doesn’t take money to have style, it just takes a really good eye.

Tony Scott is an important director, and has an amazing ability to express himself, and he doesn’t do it in musical terms , he does it in emotional terms. I got along really well with him.;Trevor Rabin;amazing 2740;Innovation is this amazing intersection between someone’s imagination and the reality in which they live. The problem is, many companies don’t have great imagination, but their view of reality tells them that it’s impossible to do what they imagine.;Ron Johnson;amazing 2741;My older brother Mike is an excellent trumpet player. By the time he was 12, he was playing around Kansas City in classical situations. He was already an amazing talent.;Pat Metheny;amazing 2742;I was about 14, and my friend’s stepdad asked me to do a 10K with him because his son - who was more into basketball - didn’t want to.

Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we’ve met a few times. I think he’s amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he’s made mistakes. He’s cool.;Cheryl Cole;amazing 2745;I would love to work with Anthony Hopkins I would love to work with Meryl Streep I would love to work with DeNiro I would love to work with Johnny Depp I’d love to work with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow… I think she’s amazing.;Tara Reid;amazing 2746;At first I missed it, but it was the amazing energy thing that happened during shows, when a lot of people were like Yay Yay Yeah!

And they’re incredibly good telly.;Ian Hislop;amazing 2748;The opportunity, number one, to work with Ang Lee is an amazing thing for me.;Sam Elliott;amazing 2749;James Franco has this interesting and relaxed look. It’s pretty ‘I don’t care,’ but it still looks good. Ryan Gosling also has amazing style. I take a lot of my fashion tips from those two. In my opinion, they’re the ones getting it right.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2750;My grandfather was one of the most amazing Baptist ministers in history, he was unbelievable. He was one of the most amazing men - the most amazing man that I ever met… He lived an amazing life.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2751;I spend up to two hours a day on correspondence. Hearing from fans on the Internet and being able to directly respond to the fan base is exciting. You can cut out the middle man like the fan club… before a recent appearance in Tyler, Texas, I had fans reaching out on MySpace offering their lake house, Mavericks tickets. It was amazing.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2752;It was a wonderful experience to work with Sylvia.

Everything is pink!;Jerry O’Connell;amazing 2754;It’s amazing how stress keeps you trim.;Peter Andre;amazing 2755;These things have a life of there own and never existed when I was growing up certainly worrying when one would get made. It’s kind of amazing how that one movie kept living through all these years.;Stockard Channing;amazing 2756;At 13, I realized that I could fix anything electronic. It was amazing, I could just do it. I started a business repairing radios. It grew to be one of the largest in Philadelphia.;Amar Bose;amazing 2757;It’s odd, because I used to see pictures, on telly or wherever, of what I now know to be Shaftesbury Avenue and I used to wonder what that amazing street with all the lights was. Well, now I know. I think when you get a wee taste of something, it maybe isn’t what you thought it was.;Shirley Henderson;amazing 2758;There was just this amazing individuality. It’s just a whole different world of optimism and fearlessness, women taking off their bras and dancing around naked, and a political hopefulness and involvement.;Jill Clayburgh;amazing 2759;The amazing thing now is that most of those so-called critics who were telling me to find my own voice seem to have lost theirs.;Brian Lumley;amazing 2760;Just going on the road and entertaining the fans, that’s amazing.;Jordan Knight;amazing 2761;If we get the capabilities, NATO, along with the European Union, can do amazing things.;Lord Robertson;amazing 2762;Acting is fantastic, but to be able to create a whole world on celluloid is amazing.

It’s an actual volcano where you really have this lava every day.;Jan de Bont;amazing 2766;Being in an area of the planet where scientists believe mankind started is quite amazing.;Jan de Bont;amazing 2767;’10’ was amazing! I had no career before ‘10’ and then all of a sudden I was able to do pretty much whatever I was able to do in the business.;Bo Derek;amazing 2768;When I see myself in the videogame it’s amazing how realistic I look. This is the most authentic and realistic soccer game I have ever seen. It is like I’m looking in a mirror. The attention to detail is incredible.;Claudio Reyna;amazing 2769;What’s amazing is that I’m recognized all over the world through ‘Red Dwarf.’ British fans are exceptional, but the American fans are something else. Some of them fly 500 miles to stand in line for three hours, just to meet me, then when they do they collapse. It makes you feel like a rock star!;Craig Charles;amazing 2770;Just knowing that through my music I actually inspire people is amazing for me and I find it very heartwarming.;Thia Megia;amazing 2771;As far as the girls in my grade, it was always kind of an on-and-off thing.

I just think it is amazing!;Atticus Shaffer;amazing 2776;I feel like I’m really blessed and lucky that I have a very good social life outside of the gym, and I have a really amazing family.

So I feel like I get the best of both worlds.;Aly Raisman;amazing 2777;Painting is the most magical of mediums.

I realized that sharks are amazing, beautiful animals who have absolutely no interest in checking me out.;Malin Akerman;amazing 2779;There were two things going on: 1) I had already established in my own mind where I wanted to go with the next series, and having James around as a Grey Eminence would have complicated matters.

I find it an amazing adventure.;Nigel Kennedy;amazing 2781;I’m overly excited to finally announce this amazing global partnership deal back home with EMI Music.

She was an amazing character and her energy followed me everywhere. When I talk about her I want to be her again.;Berenice Bejo;amazing 2789;I’ve known Shawn for several years. And he’s just an amazing talent. He’s a great writer, a marvelous, marvelous guitar player, and plays really good fiddle.;Guy Clark;amazing 2790;It was really amazing.

And he just blew us away.;Guy Clark;amazing 2791;Yoga’s an amazing release.;Monica Keena;amazing 2792;My heroes are guys like Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon.

I’m just in awe of their careers.;Dylan O’Brien;amazing 2793;In grade school I was taught that the United States is a melting pot.

Her songbooks are some of the most amazing bodies of work.;Johnny Mathis;amazing 2799;The amazing thing is that I’m sane. I’m not bitter. I’m not drugged out. I’m not broke. I’m still married to the same guy. My children don’t hate me.;Brenda Lee;amazing 2800;It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning.

By the time I saw ‘The Graduate’ I was aware of how these amazing stories could be told.;Nancy Meyers;amazing 2803;I think we love bacon because it has all the qualities of an amazing sensory experience.

Most of the time, I don’t need holidays, I just stop working.;Stephanie Beacham;amazing 2826;It is not short of amazing, the power of a great idea to weld men together.

I never realized that I would get the support that I’ve gotten from everybody - from my fans, to people that I’ve idolized my whole life.

And it’s great. It’s amazing. I’m just lucky.;Michael Welch;amazing 2877;You go through at least the first two years of Star Trek and you find some amazing stuff.
