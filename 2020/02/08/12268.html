I know, sounds a bit over the top. But I’m not as bad as I used to be. These days I don’t drink alcohol for five days before a show - very dehydrating for the vocal cords, and all that acid reflux. I used to ban it for a fortnight. Nightmare.;Katherine Jenkins;diet 14830;I do follow a version of the Dukan diet, but I don’t follow it to the extreme so a lot of fish and vegetables.

It’s a little magic powder based on Dr. Hirsh’s clinical trials and studies and it basically signals the brain that you’re full through smellology.;Patti Stanger;diet 14845;But I don’t do the diet thing anymore.

We enjoy eating a balanced diet.;Rachael Ray;diet 14852;I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America.

I’ve never had to go on a diet and that’s because of Weight Watchers.;Ginnifer Goodwin;diet 14856;I’ve drunk Amazon’s free Diet Coke.

I’m pro-books.;Lev Grossman;diet 14857;These days I travel so much it’s hard to get into a routine. When I’m on the road, I tend to use hotel gyms.

Good food choices are good investments.;Bethenny Frankel;diet 14864;My diet is mostly chicken and fish. I make sure I get a lot of vegetables, a lot of fruit.

God save us from reading nothing but the best.;Robertson Davies;diet 14870;But I can only take so much TV, because there is so much advice.

The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.;Gael Garcia Bernal;diet 14882;I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet.

I've never had to go on a diet and that's because of Weight Watchers.;Ginnifer Goodwin;diet 14856;I've drunk Amazon's free Diet Coke.

I'm pro-books.;Lev Grossman;diet 14857;These days I travel so much it's hard to get into a routine. When I'm on the road, I tend to use hotel gyms.

Good food choices are good investments.;Bethenny Frankel;diet 14864;My diet is mostly chicken and fish. I make sure I get a lot of vegetables, a lot of fruit.

God save us from reading nothing but the best.;Robertson Davies;diet 14870;But I can only take so much TV, because there is so much advice. I find people will preach about virtually anything - your diet, how to live your life, how to improve your golf. The lot.

That's my plan.;Jack Black;diet 14881;Mexican food is far more varied than people think. It changes like dialects.

The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.;Gael Garcia Bernal;diet 14882;I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet.

It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that's all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet 14888;Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat.

I think the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest… Lots of nuts, vegetables, fruits, fresh fish, lean meats, yogurt.;Cat Cora;diet
14832;I always had to diet. I’m diabetic, so it’s a lifestyle for me anyway just to stay healthy and not end up in the hospital.;Halle Berry;diet
14833;My nutritionist has done a great job in changing my diet after we established I am allergic to things like gluten - I can’t eat pizza, pasta and bread. I have lost some weight, but my movement is sharper and I feel great.;Novak Djokovic;diet
14834;I pay attention to my diet to be a healthier gymnast, but I’m not obsessive over it.;Shawn Johnson;diet
14835;As American as an apple is and as American as baseball is, they don’t go together. You can’t be chewing an apple at a baseball game. You’ve got to let go of the diet that day.;Kevin James;diet
14836;For me, it’s all about moderation. I don’t kick things out of my diet, like carbs. But I’m not going to eat fast food.;Bobby Flay;diet
14837;I can’t be on the cheeseburger diet all the time.;Bobby Flay;diet
14838;But if you pick up every other magazine, it is the peanut butter diet, or the cabbage soup diet, and then you go to the radio and you hear that you can drink some solution and you will lose weight overnight. It just does not work that way!;Richard Simmons;diet
14839;I try not to diet because it never really works for me, if I tell myself I can’t eat something then I tend to want to eat everything in sight.;Leona Lewis;diet
14840;Our pets rely on us entirely for their nutrition. So if you’re making your own judgments, that could lead to a mistake. At the same time, we have more control over our pet’s diet than we do with our children or with ourselves, so your vet can tell you what is appropriate for your dog and you can assign them that.;Alison Sweeney;diet
14841;Since having the babies, I realize that 90 percent of losing weight is my diet.;Mariah Carey;diet
14842;Unless you’re living on the street and surviving on a diet of discarded turkey drumsticks, there’s no point in being gloomy. We’ve spent too long trying to cheer ourselves up by spending money on brightly coloured things we don’t really need. We’ve stopped using our imaginations.;Jarvis Cocker;diet
14843;I had to find a diet that would kick me back into dating shape, because I know that I can’t date at size 8. I have to date at size 2. And it’s just a fact of nature. Go get your injections and your chemical peels. You gotta look good to attract a man.;Patti Stanger;diet
14844;I’m on the Sensa diet. It’s a little magic powder based on Dr. Hirsh’s clinical trials and studies and it basically signals the brain that you’re full through smellology.;Patti Stanger;diet
14845;But I don’t do the diet thing anymore. I’m a big believer in feeding your body what it needs. Deny yourself something and you’re going to end up shoving your face full of it.;Ashley Greene;diet
14846;Sometimes I’ve had to put myself on a diet.;Roger Moore;diet
14847;I was a vegan for two years, and I really enjoyed it. Then, I got to a point in my life at which I wanted to do something else, so now I’m a vegetarian. You should make your diet one that best fits you and how you feel. Listen to your body. The most important thing is to exercise, drink lots of water, and take really good care of yourself.;Lea Michele;diet
14848;I would eat healthy at times and pig out at times. But I never had to go on a strict diet plan.;Tori Spelling;diet
14849;As for my diet, I try to eat lean, clean and healthy - nothing too surprising. And I avoid too much meat or dairy because they slow you down.;Bear Grylls;diet
14850;I became a vegetarian out of compassion for animals and to live as healthy as possible. I realized soon after that I was truly concerned with nonviolent consumption and my own health, a vegan diet was the best decision.;Davey Havok;diet
14851;I’ve never been a huge sweets eater, and I’ve always loved a Mediterranean diet. We eat a lot of dark leafy greens, and a couple meals each week are meat-free. We enjoy eating a balanced diet.;Rachael Ray;diet
14852;I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.;Andrew Weil;diet
14853;In L.A., I get a meal delivery service called Diet Designs. I like a nice butter lettuce salad with some avocado, fresh grapefruit, shredded chicken breast and raw almond slices with a sesame vinaigrette dressing. I also love juicing and am kind of obsessed with it.;Fergie;diet
14854;I did every diet: Atkins. Cabbage-soup diet. Dean Ornish. But I couldn’t live the rest of my life like a rabbit.;Mike Huckabee;diet
14855;I’ve never had body issues, I’ve never had an eating disorder. I’ve never had to go on a diet and that’s because of Weight Watchers.;Ginnifer Goodwin;diet
14856;I’ve drunk Amazon’s free Diet Coke. Nothing makes more sense to me than a company trying to make bookselling into a profitable business. I’m not anti-Amazon, and I’m not pro-publishers either. I’m pro-books.;Lev Grossman;diet
14857;These days I travel so much it’s hard to get into a routine. When I’m on the road, I tend to use hotel gyms. When I’m home in L.A., I like to hike and hit the surf. All in all, I try to keep a balanced diet and exercise routine, which has stood me in good stead to date.;Curtis Stone;diet
14858;I need protein from food rather than just protein supplements. I changed my diet.;Travis Barker;diet
14859;I’ve tried just about every crazy diet you can imagine.;Brooke Burke;diet
14860;Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. You notice when you live there that there are no fat people.;Arsene Wenger;diet
14861;As a coach you can influence the diet of your players. You can point out what is wrong.;Arsene Wenger;diet
14862;All the pre-made sauces in a jar, and frozen and canned vegetables, processed meats, and cheeses which are loaded with artificial ingredients and sodium can get in the way of a healthy diet. My number one advice is to eat fresh, and seasonally.;Todd English;diet
14863;Your diet is a bank account. Good food choices are good investments.;Bethenny Frankel;diet
14864;My diet is mostly chicken and fish. I make sure I get a lot of vegetables, a lot of fruit. I am a big fruit man, I am a vegetable man anyway. And I also get a lot of rest. That’s the key I may be up early, but I’m in bed early too.;Magic Johnson;diet
14865;The doctor asked what my diet was like and I had to sit down and realize it’s not normal, and hadn’t been normal for about 20 years.;Carre Otis;diet
14866;The first couple of days on the detox diet aren’t pleasant.;Carol Vorderman;diet
14867;I was starting to become impotent through this diet and couldn’t perform. How many people who are taking the little blue pill, if they started to change what they are eating most of the time, could change the way their sex life is?;Morgan Spurlock;diet
14868;Getting as much sleep as possible and following a healthy diet will stop you from feeling run-down if, like me, you’re super-stressed.;Elizabeth Hurley;diet
14869;Do not suppose, however, that I intend to urge a diet of classics on anybody. I have seen such diets at work. I have known people who have actually read all, or almost all, the guaranteed Hundred Best Books. God save us from reading nothing but the best.;Robertson Davies;diet
14870;But I can only take so much TV, because there is so much advice. I find people will preach about virtually anything - your diet, how to live your life, how to improve your golf. The lot. I have always had a thing against the Mister Know-It-Alls.;Bill Murray;diet
14871;I’m on a strict gossip diet. No gossip websites, no gossip magazines. Otherwise, I find it paralyzing to exist.;Julie Bowen;diet
14872;The number of kids affected by obesity has tripled since 1980, and this can be traced in large part to lack of exercise and a healthy diet.;Virginia Foxx;diet
14873;The best anti-aging advice I’ve ever received? Drink a lot of water and have a plant-based diet. I also do mindful meditation with my daughter every day. It takes ten minutes. I think reducing stress plays a big part in anti-aging.;Carolyn Murphy;diet
14874;I grew up with a heavy diet of gospel, folk, and blues because those are kind of the cornerstones of traditional American music.;Ben Harper;diet
14875;In the 20 long, hungry years between my late teens and late 30s I bought in to virtually every new diet and/or exercise regime that hoved into view, particularly at this most vulnerable time for those of us prone to poor body image - a new year.;Arabella Weir;diet
14876;Sticking to a diet required me to have a permanently low self-esteem. But happily, I developed other skills beyond a fluctuating weight, eventually building up a different source of self-worth.;Arabella Weir;diet
14877;I tried the Atkins diet in the Seventies when pregnant with my son, as I didn’t want to pile on the pounds. Now, so long as I’m healthy, I don’t care what my scales say.;Britt Ekland;diet
14878;I try my best to be extremely disciplined about my diet.;Mika Brzezinski;diet
14879;My mom was always really healthy and cautious about her diet, so I’m not a big sugar guy.;Paul Walker;diet
14880;Push-ups, sit-ups, and a strict diet of raisins. That’s my plan.;Jack Black;diet
14881;Mexican food is far more varied than people think. It changes like dialects. I was brought up in Jalisco by the sea on a basic diet - tomatoes, chillis, peppers of every size and rice, which is a Mexican staple. The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.;Gael Garcia Bernal;diet
14882;I think violence, cynicism, brutality and fashion are the staples of our diet. I think in the grand history of story-telling, going back to people sitting around fires, the dark side of human nature has always been very important. Movies are part of that tradition.;Eric Stoltz;diet
14883;I’m an emotional eater. When I get upset, my diet goes out the window.;Kelly Osbourne;diet
14884;I like starting off the new year fresh. I’m excited to see how 2013 turns out. Maybe because I’m an actress and I am always on a diet and fitness program, but my New Year’s resolution is to let myself be nice to myself about my body.;Busy Philipps;diet
14885;I like food too much to go on some crazy diet. French fries are my favorite downfall.;Holly Madison;diet
14886;Going meat-free can make a huge difference. Studies show that vegetarians are, on average, 10 to 20 pounds lighter than meat-eaters and that a vegetarian diet reduces our risk of heart disease by 40 percent and adds seven or more years to our lifespan.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet
14887;Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for human beings is wean them off an animal-based diet. It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs. The last thing a poor person can afford is a heart attack or cancer or a stroke. And that’s all linked to a meat-based diet. I think animal liberation is human liberation.;Ingrid Newkirk;diet
14888;Look at the average American diet: ice cream, butter, cheese, whole milk, all this fat. People don’t realize how much of this stuff you get by the end of the day. High blood pressure is from all this high-fat eating.;Jack LaLanne;diet
14889;I won’t sit here and say I’ve never had a pimple, but I try to have a really great diet, you know, lots of vegetables and fish. And I think stress plays a huge part too.;Janelle Monae;diet
14890;And I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction, especially apocalyptic and postapocalyptic fiction.;Justin Cronin;diet
14891;I don’t have a problem with my body. I don’t diet, and I’m not hiding anything. I’m not going to be the subject of a movie of the week 10 years from now.;Lara Flynn Boyle;diet
14892;You can’t exercise your way out of a bad diet.;Mark Hyman;diet
14893;The very fact that we are having a national conversation about what we should eat, that we are struggling with the question about what the best diet is, is symptomatic of how far we have strayed from the natural conditions that gave rise to our species, from the simple act of eating real, whole, fresh food.;Mark Hyman;diet
14894;Lifestyle change and changes in diet work faster, better and more cheaply than any medication and are as effective or more effective than gastric bypass without any side effects or long-term complications.;Mark Hyman;diet
14895;When I was pregnant. I exercised and was healthy, but it was also the first time since I was 14 that I wasn’t on a diet.;Liv Tyler;diet
14896;I box for four hours a week and my diet is pretty healthy.;Tony Parsons;diet
14897;My biggest regret is putting my body through fad diets - Atkins, cleanses, the hCG diet.;Jennie Garth;diet
14898;We are also in the process of defining how best to work together with food and other companies to address diet and physical activity factors in order to prevent chronic diseases.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;diet
14899;If you can eat 70 percent raw or introduce raw into your diet, it will help your health.;Carol Alt;diet
14900;I was elected to the Diet in the same way as at every parliamentary election.;Fritz Sauckel;diet
14901;I was member of the Diet as long as it existed, until May 1933.;Fritz Sauckel;diet
14902;The Diet was dissolved by a Reich Government decree.;Fritz Sauckel;diet
14903;Far too many times over the next 12 to 15 years, it was brough</p>
