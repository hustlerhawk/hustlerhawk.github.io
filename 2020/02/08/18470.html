      <a href="/2020/02/08/1847" class="pagination--pager" title="The Dance Scene’ is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2424;I think dance is amazing because what people don’t realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You’re not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.;Laurieann Gibson;amazing 2425;Pilates is amazing, my posture is so much better and I’m even starting to get muscles on my tummy - it’s incredible.;Kelly Osbourne;amazing 2426;I enjoyed being a teammate of Deion Sanders. He brings different elements to the game that many people would not even realize, and to watch and witness a superior talent like him and watch him prepare and train, and study the game is truly amazing.;Emmitt Smith;amazing 2427;Birdie is amazing and such an incredible child and I’m having such a great time being a mom but I still want to have a career and I still look forward to auditions and parts, and when I don’t get them I’m disappointed.;Busy Philipps;amazing 2428;I get to do the most amazing things. We call it Host in Peril quite often, because people love to see me risk my life or be in danger.;Rick Mercer;amazing 2429;My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you’re 13 and you think you’re too cool for your parents. When you’re embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.;Hilary Duff;amazing 2430;I guess winning an Oscar is the ultimate dream. A lot of amazing actors go their whole career without even being nominated. So that would definitely be a goal to reach. It’s a difficult one, but I’m aiming for it!;Taylor Lautner;amazing 2431;I wouldn’t be where I am today without the amazing public arts education that I had.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2432;It’s pretty amazing being me.;Matthew Morrison;amazing 2433;Let me tell you, Barack Obama is the most down dude in the world, but he’s so smart so articulate, such an amazing speaker such a passionate man. He’s humble.;Marlon Wayans;amazing 2434;It’s amazing how fast generations lose sight of other generations. One of the first things the young composers who come to work with me say is that they want to write music people will like, instead of gaining their credentials by being rejected by the audience.;Carlisle Floyd;amazing 2435;I always use my husband’s cocoa butter stuff. He has amazing skin!;Idina Menzel;amazing 2436;My wife is amazing. She had to know she was getting into a heap of trouble when we met.;Taylor Hanson;amazing 2437;I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping, but they might see the most amazing outfit and think, ‘When am I going to wear that?’, so it’s my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;amazing 2438;I have an amazing relationship with food.;Katharine McPhee;amazing 2439;I’ve been very fortunate to be able to jump around. I just did this really wonderful film called Map of the World. That was a real, amazing, dramatic story. Then I did a movie called Company Men, a little comedy about the Bay of Pigs.;Sigourney Weaver;amazing 2440;I wore my first pair of Louboutins during this press tour. It was absolutely amazing, they weren’t heels, they were little shoes, but they were velvet and they were blue.;Chloe Moretz;amazing 2441;I jetset around and play these songs and get to hang with some pretty amazing people, then I go home to a really great farm, though actually it’s a disaster area of a farm at the moment. But it’s certainly a blast. I wouldn’t trade lives with anyone right now.;Brad Paisley;amazing 2442;It feels amazing to work with writers that write really well.;Giancarlo Esposito;amazing 2443;So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.;Uma Thurman;amazing 2444;My sister, she’s amazing. She sort of inspired me to take this journey to Latin America.;Jenna Bush;amazing 2445;Well, there are better cartoonists now than there ever have been. I firmly believe that. There’s some amazing work being done.;Chris Ware;amazing 2446;I’ve worn dresses from all different price ranges, and the thing that couture dresses have in common is that the fit is amazing.;Beyonce Knowles;amazing 2447;George Clooney is a super-human, he’s just such an amazing human being, he taught me how to be a better person and a better actor!;Shailene Woodley;amazing 2448;I mean, I’ve always said I have an amazing team and network of friends and people that I work with that, you know, inspire me and enable me to do what I do.;Alexander Wang;amazing 2449;I had an amazing experience working with great people. I had a great family, a typical family with drama in certain areas, and that’s pretty much everywhere in everyone’s life.;Tina Yothers;amazing 2450;It’s nice because success has allowed me to have a blast on stage, to be in the studio with amazing people, but I find it all a bit bizarre.;David Guetta;amazing 2451;It’s amazing what we can get away with and what we can’t. But it’s not for me to decide.;Mike Judge;amazing 2452;I feel fortunate I have this amazing relationship with so many people in America, because I was in their homes at a very private time of day. They probably might have still had their robe on and their slippers and haven’t made the beds.;Joan Lunden;amazing 2453;Science is one of a handful of things that defines us as a very special species. It is amazing how far we have been able to get and how accurate our predictions are. I think understanding how the universe was born is very important. It really gives us a perspective on many things.;Yuri Milner;amazing 2454;Isn’t it amazing how celebrity status preempts even the most ingrained hatreds?;Camryn Manheim;amazing 2455;I have experienced some amazing food! Yet when I think about the most luxurious and exquisite meals I have had, visions of simple food made from a few natural ingredients are what most excite me.;Mark Hyman;amazing 2456;I love to go shopping at Target. They have so much stuff there, you can buy almost anything, it’s really amazing.;Liv Tyler;amazing 2457;Growing up, I looked up to major league baseball players, and now these young women have amazing, incredible women all across the board, from swimming to gymnastics to softball to basketball.;Jennie Finch;amazing 2458;One thing that is almost always said to me is, I grew up with you. They are meeting me and feel that they actually grew up with me. I was with them during their play hours and thinking hours. I was a part of their childhoods. That’s one of the most amazing things.;Mark Goddard;amazing 2459;You know, it’s amazing. I don’t even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I’ve got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;amazing 2460;I know this is going to sound corny, but I love my life. I love my baby, so I love getting to wake up with him. And I have the most amazing job, with writing that any actor would love and costars who I can’t wait to see on Monday mornings. And I love coming home to my husband.;Julianna Margulies;amazing 2461;Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes. I was eight and I was like, Wow, I wanna do that!;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2462;I don’t want to wake up and not truly be enjoying my life and these amazing things around me.;LeAnn Rimes;amazing 2463;But one of the amazing things about documentary is that you can remake it every time you make one. There is no rule about how a documentary film has to be made.;Errol Morris;amazing 2464;In fact, it is amazing how much European films - Italian, French, German and English - have recovered a certain territory of the audience in their countries over the last few years.;Wim Wenders;amazing 2465;I’m from Naples. I was born in a poor neighborhood and I always, in my heart, felt like it would be amazing to be able to adopt a child from Naples. I could give someone the opportunity I had. I would love to give back in that way and pay it forward.;Giuliana Rancic;amazing 2466;I was writing a scene where a guy was choking another guy to death. You can go online and type ‘chokeholds’ and watch scenes where martial artists choke each other out. You can hear what noises they make when they go unconscious, see how their bodies flop and everything. YouTube is amazing for the more detailed stuff.;Daniel H. Wilson;amazing 2467;That show, ‘The Amazing Race’ - is that about white people?;Zach Galifianakis;amazing 2468;Each of us have things and thoughts and descriptions of an amazing universe in our possession that kings in the 17th Century would have gone to war to possess.;Kary Mullis;amazing 2469;With ‘The Host,’ I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I’d love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing… Matt Damon has some very Jared-esque qualities, and then Casey Affleck as Ian and Ben Affleck as Kyle. Imagine the interplay.;Stephenie Meyer;amazing 2470;It’s amazing that no matter how much money you have, you can make some bad decisions, and in five months you’re on the street, begging.;Paz de la Huerta;amazing 2471;I mean, there is amazing amount of oil and gas and other resources out beneath the sea. It’s staggering.;Robert Ballard;amazing 2472;I grew up in a Christian home with amazing parents.;Allyson Felix;amazing 2473;When you’re offered things, it makes it so much easier to be indecisive. And it’s silly because you can pass on some really amazing things.;Alicia Silverstone;amazing 2474;It was amazing to watch him in the darkroom at an advanced age, still get excited when the results were pleasing. He still struggled like we all do in the darkroom and he struggled behind the camera, and when he had a success he was beaming.;John Sexton;amazing 2475;My parents were amazing and wonderful, but there was a lot of pressure to do my best and in every way possible.;Kate Bosworth;amazing 2476;Elizabeth Taylor. In her heyday, she was amazing.;Joe Jonas;amazing 2477;Adele’s amazing, I think the world of her and her music and I think Tinie Tempah is cool. To work with someone like Kanye West would be awesome.;Joe Jonas;amazing 2478;I’ve never stabbed, hurt, killed, stolen, anything, but I went to jail for a year. What is that? My pastor said to me the fact that I’m not living under a bridge as a crazy woman, talking to myself, is amazing.;Foxy Brown;amazing 2479;If you ever have the good fortune to meet Tippi Hedren, she’s an amazing woman. You can’t quite believe she is the age she is.;Toby Jones;amazing 2480;Katy Perry is the sexiest woman I’ve ever kissed. It was amazing and very purple - she had purple lipstick on. I don’t think there will ever be anything cooler than kissing her… until I marry her maybe!;Niall Horan;amazing 2481;They were so good that you just had to sing the song to them once and they got it. It’s amazing. Sometimes it didn’t come out the way you wanted, but it was good.;Chris LeDoux;amazing 2482;Elle MacPherson is absolutely amazing she is just so beautiful.;Carol Alt;amazing 2483;There is something about the South that accepts the supernatural. If you don’t accept it and you’re having a conversation with someone who does, it’s just one of those polite things where you don’t question their belief in ghosts.

But I always have this weird fear that I’m not going to get any more work it’s about not having enough money.;Paul Giamatti;amazing 2501;The thing is, I don’t believe in most of what’s done.

I don’t know man. It’s amazing.;T-Pain;amazing 2524;Brains don’t really smell, but what’s amazing about the brain is that it’s almost like scrambled eggs or soft tofu, almost like a gel.

I feel so guilty.;Nikki Reed;amazing 2535;When we’d suggested doing it, the Theatre Royal management had said, ‘Nobody wants to see Waiting for Godot.’ As it happened, every single ticket was booked for every single performance, and this confirmation that our judgment was right was sweet.

I guess the theater sat 2,700 people every night so it was an amazing experience.;Blair Underwood;amazing 2560;I think Paul Newman had an amazing career. I also love what Tom Hanks has done.
