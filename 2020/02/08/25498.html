      <a href="/2020/02/08/25497" class="pagination--pager" title="Hello my name is the Republican Party and I got a problem. I’m addicted to spending and big government.’ I’d like one of them just to stand up and say that.;Glenn Beck;government 30268;If the jury have no right to judge of the justice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect the people against the oppressions of the government for there are no oppressions which the government may not authorize by law.;Lysander Spooner;government 30269;There is nothing inherently fair about equalizing incomes. If the government penalizes you for working harder than somebody else, that is unfair. If you save your money but retire with the same pension as a free-spending neighbor, that is also unfair.;Arthur C. Brooks;government 30270;The office of government is not to confer happiness, but to give men the opportunity to work out happiness for themselves.;William Ellery Channing;government 30271;Wherever magistrates were appointed from among those who complied with the injunctions of the laws, Socrates considered the government to be an aristocracy.;Xenophon;government 30272;The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.;William Jennings Bryan;government 30273;Good government is the outcome of private virtue.;John Jay Chapman;government 30274;Our citizens are tired of big government raising their taxes and cooking up new ways to micromanage their lives, our citizens are tired of big government killing jobs with their do-gooder policies. In short the people are Fed Up!;Rick Perry;government 30275;Conservatives are winning offices, and champions of big government are cleaning out their desks right now.;Rick Perry;government 30276;America’s greatness is not found in the size of its government. America’s greatness resides in the hearts and the minds of the people.;Rick Perry;government 30277;Morals are in all countries the result of legislation and government they are not African or Asian or European: they are good or bad.;Denis Diderot;government 30278;Public confidence in the integrity of the Government is indispensable to faith in democracy and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for.;Adlai E. Stevenson;government 30279;History proves that all dictatorships, all authoritarian forms of government are transient. Only democratic systems are not transient. Whatever the shortcomings, mankind has not devised anything superior.;Vladimir Putin;government 30280;The government is not your salvation. The government is not your road to prosperity. Hard work, education will take you far beyond what any government program can ever promise.;Mia Love;government 30281;Folks, this government isn’t too big to fail, it’s too big to succeed.;Sarah Palin;government 30282;Every government must consider the security of the country. That is just part of the responsibilities of any government. But true security can only come out of unity within a country where there are so many ethnic nationalities.;Aung San Suu Kyi;government 30283;All that a good government aims at… is to add no unnecessary and artificial aid to the force of its own unavoidable consequences, and to abstain from fortifying and accumulating social inequality as a means of increasing political inequalities.;James F. Cooper;government 30284;There is something fundamentally unfair about a government that takes away so much of people’s money, power, and personal control while telling them that life will be better as a result.;Steve Forbes;government 30285;I would have been glad to have lived under my wood side, and to have kept a flock of sheep, rather than to have undertaken this government.;Oliver Cromwell;government 30286;If I had been under ObamaCare, and a beaurocrat had been trying to tell me when I could get that CT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could based upon my timetable, and not the government’s timetable. That’s what saved my life.;Herman Cain;government 30287;I am often asked if, when I was secretary, I had problems with foreign men. That is not who I had problems with, because I arrived in a very large plane that said United States of America. I had more problems with the men in our own government.;Madeleine Albright;government 30288;I wasn’t a normal professor. I had worked in government. I hadn’t written nine zillion books. I was a hands-on professor.;Madeleine Albright;government 30289;The measure of a man is not how great his faith is, but how great his love is. We must not let government programs disconnect our souls from each other.;J. C. Watts;government 30290;Every American, regardless of their background, has the right to live free of unwarranted government intrusion. Repealing the worst provisions of the Patriot Act will reign in this gross abuse of power and restore to everyone our basic Constitutional rights.;Pete Stark;government 30291;The conservative movement today is like that tall ship with its proud captain: strong, accomplished but veering off course into the dangerous and uncharted waters of big government republicanism.;Mike Pence;government 30292;It is unfortunate that Americans are no longer aware of what the constitution says and what their rights are. Because of that, we are often very passive about what happens when the government violates those rights.;James Bovard;government 30293;The fundamental purpose of government is to protect its citizens.;Arlen Specter;government 30294;The relationships that people have - that are sexual, psychological, emotional - these relationships are not open to supervision by parents, schools, churches, or government. Nobody has any right to intervene at all in any kind of relationship like that.;Madalyn Murray O’Hair;government 30295;The thought about Republicans is, we’re supposed to be Jeffersonian. That government governs the best that governs the least.;Pat Robertson;government 30296;To declare that in the administration of criminal law the end justifies the means to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribution.;Louis D. Brandeis;government 30297;A world in which government is burdened by historic debt, philanthropy has limited resources, and the private sector is only interested in its own personal gain is simply unsustainable.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30298;Corporations often partner with government after natural disasters, as many companies did in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As a rule, however, long-term civic/corporate partnerships are still rare .But this need not remain the status quo, as many opportunities are available for such partnerships.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30299;The United States is at a critical juncture in time. Our government is riddled with historic debt, and the limited resources of philanthropic and non-profit efforts cannot meet the scale of social challenges we face with necessary force.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30300;It is time for corporate America to become ‘the third pillar’ of social change in our society, complementing the first two pillars of government and philanthropy. We need the entire private sector to begin committing itself not just to making profits, but to fulfilling higher and larger purposes by contributing to building a better world.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30301;Non-disclosure in the Internet Age is quickly perceived as a breach of trust. Government, corporations and each of us as individuals must recalibrate how we live and share our lives appropriate to the information now available and the expectations of others.;Simon Mainwaring;government 30302;It is the duty of government to make it difficult for people to do wrong, easy to do right.;William E. Gladstone;government 30303;I don’t believe that government is good at picking technology, particularly technology that is changing. By the time you get it done and go through democracy, it’s so outdated.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30304;The average Nigerian person has come to reconcile himself with the fact that his or her social progress remain essentially in his or her hands in collaboration with other fellow Nigerians and not merely relying on what government alone could provide for him or her.;Ibrahim Babangida;government 30305;If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.;Frank Herbert;government 30306;You can’t have it both ways. You can’t tell me that you’re taxed enough already, and that you want constitutional government and then in the next breath say, ‘Bring me home some bacon.’ The pig has been picked clean.;Rand Paul;government 30307;In Michigan, a liberal democrat raised taxes and kept their government programs at the same level. And guess what? Their economy continued into the toilet, it continued down.;Rick Perry;government 30308;This administration in Washington that’s in power now clearly believes that government is not only the answer to every need, but it’s the most qualified to make the most central decisions for every American in every area.;Rick Perry;government 30309;Our goal is to displace the entrenched powers in Washington, restore the rightful balance between the state and federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30310;When the good lord calls you home, the government ought not come get your home.;Rick Perry;government 30311;President Obama’s call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.;Rick Perry;government 30312;Americans want government that is leaner, more efficient, and less intrusive into their personal lives.;Rick Perry;government 30313;Who can be against progress, after all? But it’s a fraudulent use of the word - because for the Progressive, progress is marked not be how free you are, but how much government can ‘do’ for you.;Rick Perry;government 30314;It is through states that the American people get the job done every day, often in spite of a deeply flawed bureaucratic federal government.;Rick Perry;government 30315;We believe in government involvement that leads to independence: good schools, quality roads and the best health care.;Rick Perry;government 30316;The benefits of education and of useful knowledge, generally diffused through a community, are essential to the preservation of a free government.;Sam Houston;government 30317;People know something has gone terribly wrong with our government and it has gotten so far off track. But people also know that there is nothing wrong in America that a good old-fashioned election can’t fix.;Sarah Palin;government 30318;New York State is upside down and backwards high taxes and low performance. The New York State government was at one time a national model. Now, unfortunately, it’s a national disgrace. Sometimes, the corruption in Albany could even make Boss Tweed blush.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30319;Too often government responds to the whispers of lobbyists before the cries of the people.;Andrew Cuomo;government 30320;I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn’t possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There’s a relationship to government about knights.;Harold Pinter;government 30321;And we can celebrate when we have a government that has earned back the trust of the people it serves… when we have a government that honors our Constitution and stands up for the values that have made America, America: economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.;John Boehner;government 30322;President Reagan was elected on the promise of getting government off the backs of the people and now he demands that government wrap itself around the waists of the people.;Ralph Nader;government 30323;Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.;Ralph Nader;government 30324;Well, we lost a lot of our independence already. We are dependent on China for credit. We are dependent on Middle Eastern countries for energy supplies. And many Americans are dependent on the government for their income, health care, education of their children, food stamps.;Jim DeMint;government 30325;The three great ends which a statesman ought to propose to himself in the government of a nation, are one, Security to possessors two, facility to acquirers and three, hope to all.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;government 30326;The vast amount of waste and sheer stupidity in government - from the Pentagon to the Food and Drug Administration - could fill committee agendas for years.;Tom Coburn;government 30327;Ours is a government of checks and balances.

Clinton;government 30335;My philosophy is not a bean-counting, accounting ‘look at this.’ It is a philosophy that smaller government is better government, and government that is closer to the people is best of all.;John Bolton;government 30336;Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.;John Podhoretz;government 30337;Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It’s a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.;John Podhoretz;government 30338;The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.;John Podhoretz;government 30339;By the time Obama came into office, Washington had already agreed over a period of a few weeks to a $700 billion government infusion into the world banking system. Nothing of the sort had ever been done before, and it was done spit spot with very little national debate.;John Podhoretz;government 30340;Institutions - government, churches, industries, and the like - have properly no other function than to contribute to human freedom and in so far as they fail, on the whole, to perform this function, they are wrong and need reconstruction.;Charles Horton Cooley;government 30341;We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention.

We haven’t heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists. Everybody’s afraid of the government and there’s no need soft peddling it, it’s the truth. It is the truth.;Steve Wynn;government 30353;Higher taxes is the road to ruin. We must and we will shrink our government, and that means making some tough choices, tightening our belts.;Chris Christie;government 30354;I think the country’s getting disgusted with Washington partly because of the decline of civility in government.;George McGovern;government 30355;A president who breaks the law is a threat to the very structure of our government.;Al Gore;government 30356;The public is upset. If they haven’t lost their job, they know somebody that has. If they haven’t lost their house, they know somebody that has. What do you do? When something’s wrong, it’s government’s job to fix it, it must be government that’s responsible for causing it.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30357;Whatever you may think of the proposed mosque and community center, lost in the heat of the debate has been a basic question: Should government attempt to deny private citizens the right to build a house of worship on private property based on their particular religion?;Michael Bloomberg;government 30358;Government shouldn’t tell you whom to marry.;Michael Bloomberg;government 30359;We just put General Motors in the hands of people who can’t even run our own government.;Glenn Beck;government 30360;I cannot think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament.;Tony Blair;government 30361;In government you carry each hope each disillusion.

And it shouldn’t be up to the government.;Tony Campolo;government 30380;President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?;Tony Campolo;government 30381;I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.;Tony Campolo;government 30382;If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?;Tony Campolo;government 30383;From the beginning, there have been some religious leaders who greeted the funding of faith-based social services by government with ambivalence.;Tony Campolo;government 30384;After-school tutoring programs, care for the elderly, shelters for the homeless, disaster relief work, and a variety of other services would all benefit from government funding.;Tony Campolo;government 30385;Getting the government to put money into social programs run by religious institutions is a practice that started during the Clinton years, when Bill Clinton advocated the AmeriCorps program.;Tony Campolo;government 30386;Clinton’s successor in the White House, George W.

It was designed to take the government off the backs of people.;William O.
