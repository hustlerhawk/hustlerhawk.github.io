<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>Untitled’ is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it’s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art’s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;’Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,’ the Whitney Museum’s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it’ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don’t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn’t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They’re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade’s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I’d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade’s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager’s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you’re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art’s version of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It’s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I’ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn’t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn’t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that’s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, ‘The Clock’ is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don’t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I’ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they’re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I’m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he’s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he’s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you’re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a ‘conflict of interest.’ But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren’t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We’re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We’re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can’t provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time’s malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It’s an art to live with pain… mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art 4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art 4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art 4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art 4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art 4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art 4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art 4397;Music is God’s gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art 4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art 4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art 4400;Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4401;Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art 4402;Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don’t talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it’s stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that’s it. No America, no jazz. I’ve seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I’m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we’re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I’m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it’s one of the great things about making movies is it’s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character’s costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn’t normal. I didn’t have to go to school, so I didn’t. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I’m almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I’m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that’s a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art. I love the fact that I can be one guy with one instrument evoking an emotional and musical experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;art 4417;I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art 4418;Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art 4419;Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art 4420;People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it’s simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art 4421;There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art 4422;The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art 4423;The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn’t make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art 4424;I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it’s well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4428;It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4429;Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4430;Art is not living. It is the use of living.;Audre Lorde;art 4431;The work of art is a scream of freedom.;Christo;art 4432;The body is your instrument in dance, but your art is outside that creature, the body.;Martha Graham;art 4433;Art is contemplation.

You shouldn’t read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it’s the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don’t think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don’t think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

Everything else is everything else.;Ad Reinhardt;art 4458;All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.;Walter Pater;art 4459;I’ve got tonnes of aboriginal and Native American art, but I’d like even more.;Tori Amos;art 4460;I don’t want life to imitate art.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It’s an honor putting art above politics.

For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist’s obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don’t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn’t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They’re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade’s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I’d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade’s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager’s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you’re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art’s version of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It’s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I’ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn’t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn’t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that’s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, ‘The Clock’ is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don’t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I’ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they’re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I’m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he’s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he’s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you’re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a ‘conflict of interest.’ But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren’t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We’re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We’re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can’t provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time’s malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It’s an art to live with pain… mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art 4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art 4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art 4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art 4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art 4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art 4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art 4397;Music is God’s gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art 4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art 4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art 4400;Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4401;Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art 4402;Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don’t talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it’s stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that’s it. No America, no jazz. I’ve seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I’m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we’re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I’m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it’s one of the great things about making movies is it’s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character’s costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn’t normal. I didn’t have to go to school, so I didn’t. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I’m almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I’m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that’s a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art. I love the fact that I can be one guy with one instrument evoking an emotional and musical experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;art 4417;I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art 4418;Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art 4419;Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art 4420;People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it’s simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art 4421;There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art 4422;The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art 4423;The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn’t make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art 4424;I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it’s well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4428;It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4429;Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4430;Art is not living.

You shouldn’t read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it’s the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don’t think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don’t think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It’s an honor putting art above politics.

Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Untitled’ is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it’s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art’s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;’Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,’ the Whitney Museum’s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it’ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don’t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn’t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They’re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade’s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I’d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade’s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager’s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you’re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art’s version of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It’s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I’ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn’t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn’t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that’s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, ‘The Clock’ is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don’t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I’ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they’re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I’m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he’s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he’s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you’re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a ‘conflict of interest.’ But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren’t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We’re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We’re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can’t provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time’s malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It’s an art to live with pain… mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art 4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art 4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art 4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art 4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art 4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art 4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art 4397;Music is God’s gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art 4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art 4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art 4400;Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4401;Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art 4402;Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don’t talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it’s stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that’s it. No America, no jazz. I’ve seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I’m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we’re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I’m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it’s one of the great things about making movies is it’s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character’s costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn’t normal. I didn’t have to go to school, so I didn’t. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I’m almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I’m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that’s a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art. I love the fact that I can be one guy with one instrument evoking an emotional and musical experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;art 4417;I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art 4418;Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art 4419;Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art 4420;People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it’s simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art 4421;There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art 4422;The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art 4423;The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn’t make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art 4424;I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it’s well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4428;It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4429;Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4430;Art is not living. It is the use of living.;Audre Lorde;art 4431;The work of art is a scream of freedom.;Christo;art 4432;The body is your instrument in dance, but your art is outside that creature, the body.;Martha Graham;art 4433;Art is contemplation. It is the pleasure of the mind which searches into nature and which there divines the spirit of which nature herself is animated.;Auguste Rodin;art 4434;Education is the art of making man ethical.;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel;art 4435;The art of mastering life is the prerequisite for all further forms of expression, whether they are paintings, sculptures, tragedies, or musical compositions.;Paul Klee;art 4436;I like science and I love gym. Oh, and I like art, but I’m really bad at it. I’m just a terrible drawer. I can’t draw a circle. Even with a ruler, I can’t draw a straight line.;Daniel Radcliffe;art 4437;Modesty: the gentle art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it.;Oliver Herford;art 4438;I don’t watch television, I think it destroys the art of talking about oneself.;Stephen Fry;art 4439;Great art speaks a language which every intelligent person can understand. The people who call themselves modernists today speak a different language.;Marshall McLuhan;art 4440;All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn’t read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it’s the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don’t think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don’t think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

Everything else is everything else.;Ad Reinhardt;art 4458;All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.;Walter Pater;art 4459;I’ve got tonnes of aboriginal and Native American art, but I’d like even more.;Tori Amos;art 4460;I don’t want life to imitate art.

You talk to people who are really clued in to all the young artists and coming into it you’re never going to be able to catch up immediately, even though there’s pressure to.;Daniel Radcliffe;art 4469;I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.;Jim Davis;art 4471;Art is the most passionate orgy within man’s grasp.;John Donne;art 4472;Smiles come naturally to me, but I started thinking of them as an art form at my command. I studied all the time. I looked at magazines, I’d practice in front of the mirror and I’d ask photographers about the best angles. I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It’s an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.;Robert Redford;art 4475;I’m not interested in pop art.;Billy Corgan;art 4476;Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4477;In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4478;Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art 4479;An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4480;Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4481;Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4482;Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems.

For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.;Camille Paglia;art 4491;And I have exposed myself to art so that my work has something beyond just the usual potter.;Beatrice Wood;art 4492;Originality is the art of concealing your source.;Franklin P.

I work for art.;Maria Callas;art 4496;Customs and convictions change respectable people are the last to know, or to admit, the change, and the ones most offended by fresh reflections of the facts in the mirror of art.;John Updike;art 4497;When hospitality becomes an art it loses its very soul.;Max Beerbohm;art 4498;A verbal art like poetry is reflective it stops to think.

H. Auden;art 4500;Art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.;W. H. Auden;art 4501;The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art 4502;I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art 4503;All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art 4504;In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist’s obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

          <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Untitled’ is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it’s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art’s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;’Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,’ the Whitney Museum’s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it’ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don’t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn’t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They’re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade’s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I’d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade’s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager’s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you’re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art’s version of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It’s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I’ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn’t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn’t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that’s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, ‘The Clock’ is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don’t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I’ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they’re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I’m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he’s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he’s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you’re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a ‘conflict of interest.’ But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren’t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We’re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We’re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can’t provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time’s malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It’s an art to live with pain… mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W.

Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it’s stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that’s it. No America, no jazz. I’ve seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn’t have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I’m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we’re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I’m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it’s one of the great things about making movies is it’s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character’s costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn’t normal. I didn’t have to go to school, so I didn’t. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I’m almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I’m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that’s a big one for relaxation.

Music is immediate, it goes on to become.;W. H. Auden;art 4499;It’s a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.;W. H. Auden;art 4500;Art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.;W. H. Auden;art 4501;The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art 4502;I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art 4503;All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art 4504;In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist’s obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.;Henri Frederic Amiel;art 4506;In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading ‘Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

    <a href="https://z19fzzgmr7biysixl4mndq-on.drv.tw/website/assets/images/motivation/3327/0.webp" title="Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art 4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art 4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art 4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art 4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art 4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art 4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art 4397;Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art 4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art 4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art 4400;Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4401;Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art 4402;Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art.

I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art 4418;Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art 4419;Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art 4420;People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it's simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art 4421;There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art 4422;The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art 4423;The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn't make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art 4424;I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it's well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4428;It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4429;Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4430;Art is not living.

You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it's the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don't think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don't think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

You talk to people who are really clued in to all the young artists and coming into it you're never going to be able to catch up immediately, even though there's pressure to.;Daniel Radcliffe;art 4469;I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It's an honor putting art above politics.

Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

Auden;art 4501;The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art 4502;I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art 4503;All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art 4504;In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.;Henri Frederic Amiel;art 4506;In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.">

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W.

Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art.

I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it's well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable.

You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it's the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don't think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don't think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art 4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art 4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art 4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art 4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art 4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art 4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art 4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art 4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art 4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art 4397;Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art 4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art 4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art 4400;Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4401;Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art 4402;Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art 4403;Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art 4404;Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art 4405;Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art 4406;Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art 4407;Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation. I also love to go to art and history museums.;Christina Aguilera;art 4416;Piano playing is a dying art. I love the fact that I can be one guy with one instrument evoking an emotional and musical experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;art 4417;I don't believe in art. I believe in artists.;Marcel Duchamp;art 4418;Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.;Lincoln Steffens;art 4419;Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.;Lewis Mumford;art 4420;People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it's simply necessary to love.;Claude Monet;art 4421;There is no more difficult art to acquire than the art of observation, and for some men it is quite as difficult to record an observation in brief and plain language.;William Osler;art 4422;The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.;Pope Paul VI;art 4423;The contemporary thing in art and literature is the thing which doesn't make enough difference to the people of that generation so that they can accept it or reject it.;Gertrude Stein;art 4424;I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it's well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable. This transitory fugitive element, which is constantly changing, must not be despised or neglected.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4428;It is from the womb of art that criticism was born.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4429;Modernity signifies the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art of which the other half is the eternal and the immutable.;Charles Baudelaire;art 4430;Art is not living.

You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it's the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don't think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don't think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It's an honor putting art above politics.

The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art 4479;An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4480;Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4481;Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4482;Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems.

For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics.

Bulwer-Lytton;art 4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art 4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art 4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art 4389;It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art 4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W.

Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz.

To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation.

Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say.

It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art 4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art 4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art 4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics.

I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation.

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions.

It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb.

Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game.

First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone.

It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions.

I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind.

But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important.

I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It's an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.;Robert Redford;art 4475;I'm not interested in pop art.;Billy Corgan;art 4476;Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4477;In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4478;Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art 4479;An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4480;Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4481;Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4482;Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems.

For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.;Camille Paglia;art 4491;And I have exposed myself to art so that my work has something beyond just the usual potter.;Beatrice Wood;art 4492;Originality is the art of concealing your source.;Franklin P.

To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.'

Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say.

Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz.

I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation.

You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person.

I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating.

I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It's an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.;Robert Redford;art 4475;I'm not interested in pop art.;Billy Corgan;art 4476;Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4477;In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4478;Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art 4479;An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4480;Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4481;Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4482;Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems.

It has been more difficult to conceive it so than to act it so. For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.;Camille Paglia;art 4491;And I have exposed myself to art so that my work has something beyond just the usual potter.;Beatrice Wood;art 4492;Originality is the art of concealing your source.;Franklin P.

Auden;art 4501;The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art 4502;I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art 4503;All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art 4504;In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

    <a href="https://z19fzzgmr7biysixl4mndq-on.drv.tw/website/assets/images/motivation/3327/4.webp" title="Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art 4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art 4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art 4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art 4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art 4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art 4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art 4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art 4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects.

I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies.

Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years.

The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music.

Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art 4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art 4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art 4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art 4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art 4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art 4339;'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art 4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art 4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art 4342;The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art 4343;Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art 4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art 4345;Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art 4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art 4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art 4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art 4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art 4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art 4352;I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art 4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art 4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art 4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art 4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art 4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art 4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art 4359;We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art 4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art 4361;I don't listen to what art critics say.

It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art 4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art 4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art 4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art 4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art 4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects.

Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art 4408;Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art 4409;Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art 4410;To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art 4411;I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art 4412;I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art 4413;A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art 4414;Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art 4415;I love doing normal things - movies, shopping, going out with friends, writing, reading, taking hot bubble baths - that's a big one for relaxation.

I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.;Ellie Goulding;art 4425;The art of pleasing is the art of deception.;Luc de Clapiers;art 4426;Football is an art, like dancing is an art - but only when it's well done does it become an art.;Arsene Wenger;art 4427;Modernity is the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent, which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable.

You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.;Leslie Fiedler;art 4441;The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person and in the end they unite.;Havelock Ellis;art 4442;My parents started with very little and were the only ones in their families to graduate from college. As parents, they focused on education, but did not stop at academics - they made sure that we knew music, saw art and theatre and traveled - even though it meant budgeting like crazy.;Jennifer Garner;art 4443;A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.;Helen Rowland;art 4444;Film in the 20th century, it's the American art form, like jazz.;Martin Scorsese;art 4445;Nature is the art of God.;Dante Alighieri;art 4446;I don't think there is such a thing as being too raunchy when it comes to the art form of burlesque.;Christina Aguilera;art 4447;I don't think art is propaganda it should be something that liberates the soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go further.

You talk to people who are really clued in to all the young artists and coming into it you're never going to be able to catch up immediately, even though there's pressure to.;Daniel Radcliffe;art 4469;I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I tell them the truth and they never believe me.;Camillo di Cavour;art 4470;There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.;Jim Davis;art 4471;Art is the most passionate orgy within man's grasp.;John Donne;art 4472;Smiles come naturally to me, but I started thinking of them as an art form at my command. I studied all the time. I looked at magazines, I'd practice in front of the mirror and I'd ask photographers about the best angles. I can now pull out a smile at will.;Tyra Banks;art 4473;Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.;Hans Hofmann;art 4474;It's an honor putting art above politics. Politics can be seductive in terms of things reductive to the soul.;Robert Redford;art 4475;I'm not interested in pop art.;Billy Corgan;art 4476;Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4477;In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4478;Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.;Laura Riding;art 4479;An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4480;Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4481;Form your life humanly, and you have done enough: but you will never reach the height of art and the depth of science without something divine.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art 4482;Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.;Alvar Aalto;art 4483;As I grew older, I realized that it was much better to insist on the genuine forms of nature, for simplicity is the greatest adornment of art.;Albrecht Durer;art 4484;I think of art, at its most significant, as a DEW line, a Distant Early Warning system that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it.;Marshall McLuhan;art 4485;I'd love to go to art school.

It has been more difficult to conceive it so than to act it so. For that is always how he has more or less acted it.;Havelock Ellis;art 4488;Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!;Camille Paglia;art 4489;Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.;Peter Hammill;art 4490;Does art have a future? Performance genres like opera, theater, music and dance are thriving all over the world, but the visual arts have been in slow decline for nearly 40 years. No major figure of profound influence has emerged in painting or sculpture since the waning of Pop Art and the birth of Minimalism in the early 1970s.;Camille Paglia;art 4491;And I have exposed myself to art so that my work has something beyond just the usual potter.;Beatrice Wood;art 4492;Originality is the art of concealing your source.;Franklin P.

Auden;art 4501;The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.;Pablo Casals;art 4502;I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.;Judy Chicago;art 4503;All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.;W. H. Auden;art 4504;In every work of art the subject is primordial, whether the artist knows it or not. The measure of the formal qualities is only a sign of the measure of the artist's obsession with his subject the form is always in proportion to the obsession.;Alberto Giacometti;art 4505;To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.;Henri Frederic Amiel;art 4506;In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance." />

<p>Untitled’ is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art
4334;Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it’s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art
4335;A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art
4336;The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art
4337;Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art
4338;Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art’s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art
4339;’Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,’ the Whitney Museum’s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it’ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art
4340;Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art
4341;Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don’t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art
4342;The reason the art world doesn’t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They’re all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art
4343;Kinkade’s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I’d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade’s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art
4344;Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art
4345;Artschwager’s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you’re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art
4346;Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art’s version of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. It’s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art
4347;The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I’ve ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art
4348;If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn’t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art
4349;Art is for anyone. It just isn’t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that’s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art
4350;I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art
4351;A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, ‘The Clock’ is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art
4352;I don’t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I’ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art
4353;I love art dealers. In some ways, they’re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art
4354;When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art
4355;I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I’m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art
4356;Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he’s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he’s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you’re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art
4357;Many say an art dealer running a museum is a ‘conflict of interest.’ But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art
4358;Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren’t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art
4359;We’re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We’re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art
4360;Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art
4361;I don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art
4362;To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art
4363;Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art
4364;Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art
4365;Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west’s stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art’s assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art
4366;Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art
4367;Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art
4368;What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art
4369;Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can’t provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art
4370;Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art
4371;Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art
4372;As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art
4373;The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4374;Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4375;You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4376;There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4377;The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4378;The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
4379;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art
4380;With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time’s malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art
4381;Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art
4382;Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art
4383;I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art
4384;Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art
4385;Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art
4386;Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art
4387;I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art
4388;A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art
4389;It’s an art to live with pain… mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art
4390;Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art
4391;Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art
4392;I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art
4393;Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art
4394;In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art
4395;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art
4396;Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art
4397;Music is God’s gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art
4398;The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art
4399;I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art
