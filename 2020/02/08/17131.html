<!-- begin _includes/seo.html --><title>I Know You Care’ is really personal and fragile for me. For me, it’s about losing a family member and also about a breakup. It’s about this idea of losing someone for good.;Ellie Goulding;family 20786;Getting and keeping my immunity became very important to me. For I needed to take care of myself and my family. No one else was worried about me.;Monica Lewinsky;family 20787;I was the black sheep of the family, and my mother never really understood me.;Andre Rieu;family 20788;Of course, I will continue to share my favorite Southern recipes, just like my mama, grandmother and family shared with me over the years. And now, I’ll be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes.;Paula Deen;family 20789;What we’ve tried to do is have neighbors, colleagues, friends and family talking.;David Plouffe;family 20790;Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live.;Hans-Georg Gadamer;family 20791;Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, brain and spinal cord disorders, diabetes, cancer, at least 58 diseases could potentially be cured through stem cell research, diseases that touch every family in America and in the world.;Rosa DeLauro;family 20792;When you go to the movies with your whole family, it’s a different experience. For some reason, it’s something that you’re all doing together and you take away something special in that.;Vin Diesel;family 20793;I was the oldest of the children in my family. I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making. I was taking my little sister to ballet, picking up my brother, sort of being a super-nanny.;Vin Diesel;family 20794;And having a strong family, you know we’ve lost some members of our family and had some setbacks, but I think a good family and kids all those things I thought at one time… you got to be kidding me… Those things are so important they enable you to go on.;Brett Favre;family 20795;Well family is obviously the most important. There was a time when I thought football was the most important.;Brett Favre;family 20796;In spite of reports about playing with various teams, I’m enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football.;Brett Favre;family 20797;I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I’m the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I’m not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I’m just relaxing and enjoying it.;Betty White;family 20798;It’s a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That’s why it’s a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.;Betty White;family 20799;I’m thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.;Nicki Minaj;family 20800;When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that’s what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.;Leighton Meester;family 20801;My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don’t like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I’m not Nicki Minaj when I’m with them.;Nicki Minaj;family 20802;What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don’t write the book where it’s a conspiracy reaching the prime minister I don’t write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.;Harlan Coben;family 20803;A racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family.;Saul Alinsky;family 20804;Frankly I’m fairly boring or fairly busy. Between writing and family, I have little time for anything else.;Harlan Coben;family 20805;If I’m not writing well, I’m not happy. If I’m not spending enough time with my family, I’m not happy. If I’m not connecting to friends or if I don’t work out enough… You get the point. Everything has to be balanced. Nothing should be an extreme.;Harlan Coben;family 20806;I always wanted to be a farmer. There is a tradition of that in my family.;Bjork;family 20807;The Royal family to me are not England, and they are not the flag.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20808;My family, although they’re very large on both my parents’ sides, they don’t know much about their family tree. Occasionally, they try to dig, but they can’t get very far, and it’s baffling. In Dublin, it seems that so many public records were wiped out it’s proven to be very difficult, so I know very little.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20809;Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.;Heath Ledger;family 20810;I’m not sure why no one wants to admit there’s a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.;Tyler Perry;family 20811;Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20812;Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20813;Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20814;We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20815;I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry, because I don’t think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made, but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family 20816;No journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where I live. I don’t parade my family out for display, which is the way it will stay.;Tom Hanks;family 20817;I’ve always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I’d put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.;Emma Roberts;family 20818;We fight a lot, you know, but that’s family. We may be dysfunctional but we’re still family.;Star Jones;family 20819;I like all the families in the U.K. But what I like about the idea of the royal family is… they seem like they’re well educated and there’s something admirable about them. And the Queen… she reminds me of my grandma.;will.i.am;family 20820;I’m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I’ve been.;Tom Hardy;family 20821;If you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your family’s life but change your ghetto’s life, make your ghetto a good neighbourhood, learn science try to be like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.;will.i.am;family 20822;If you live in a good neighborhood, you drive home and there’s a bank. There’s grocery stores and big houses - but no motels. What that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house.;will.i.am;family 20823;Respectable means rich, and decent means poor. I should die if I heard my family called decent.;Thomas Mann;family 20824;The countries who do the best in international comparisons, whether it’s Finland or Japan, Denmark or Singapore, do well because they have professional teachers who are respected, and they also have family and community which support learning.;Howard Gardner;family 20825;The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality.;Talcott Parsons;family 20826;My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school. So I was always moving, I’m still always moving.;Gus Van Sant;family 20827;There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.;Gus Van Sant;family 20828;If I’m diagnosed with cancer I might become despondent, but someone young might not, and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent.;Gus Van Sant;family 20829;My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school.;Gus Van Sant;family 20830;Because I didn’t have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family.;Gus Van Sant;family 20831;According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.;Kit Bond;family 20832;I wasn’t looking to get into TV. My family was in the movie business, so I was never interested in that world.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20833;The summer before I went to culinary school, my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that I was making the right decision. I think they hoped I would change my mind about culinary school.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20834;My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I’m just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they’re older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20835;I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes. I don’t care if it’s a black family from Jamaica or a Hispanic family from Mexico. These issues need to be dealt with, but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way.;Harvey Weinstein;family 20836;A plague on eminence! I hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy, and I am stared at wherever I go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo and zoo animals have been known to die from stares.;Igor Stravinsky;family 20837;I’m a strange mixture of my mother’s curiosity my father, who grew up the son of the manse in a Presbyterian family, who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility and my mother’s father, who was always in trouble with gambling debts.;Rupert Murdoch;family 20838;I’m considered homophobic and crazy about these things and old fashioned. But I think that the family - father, mother, children - is fundamental to our civilisation.;Rupert Murdoch;family 20839;I’d be a liar if I said I had a normal family.;Edward Furlong;family 20840;I sometimes wonder if the tragedies my family has suffered are a kind of karmic price for all the fame and fortune the Bee Gees have had.;Robin Gibb;family 20841;In a couple, sometimes, one or both people have to give up their personal life, dreams and ambitions for the good of the family.;Monica Bellucci;family 20842;The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20843;When I’m on my own, I can be negative.

I think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople.;Jenson Button;family 20844;I do a lot of writing about my family.;Katey Sagal;family 20845;By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20846;I do not believe the picture that some people paint of Scottish towns dependent on welfare. Every time I come here, I meet people who are determined to get into work. Who, with the right help are desperate to get off benefits, support their family and set an example for their children.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20847;Getting a family into work, supporting strong relationships, getting parents off drugs and out of debt - all this can do more for a child’s well-being than any amount of money in out-of-work benefits.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20848;Choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people. It was a way to choose a new family.;Juliette Binoche;family 20849;The extraordinary thing about India is that it’s such a family place. It’s full of families everywhere.;Danny Boyle;family 20850;God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine.;Jerry Falwell;family 20851;I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it’s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.;Sophia Bush;family 20852;Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it’s like you don’t ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it’s kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.;Sophia Bush;family 20853;Family is becoming more and more important to me.;Diane Kruger;family 20854;You know, most people, they want to go to Hollywood. They want to be a star. They want to be a rock star. That thought never entered any of our minds, the Van Halen family.;Eddie Van Halen;family 20855;I love being healthy. I get a lot of sleep.

I’m not comfortable with the idea of serving the many and ignoring my family.;Susan Sarandon;family 20860;It is from the progeny of this parent cell that we all take our looks we still share genes around, and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is in fact a family resemblance.;Lewis Thomas;family 20861;Until he lost all his money, my father was a successful north London Jewish businessman. He was unusual among his immediate family in that he was enormously cultured and had an incredible library.;Anthony Horowitz;family 20862;I don’t want to be reincarnated, that’s for sure. When you’ve had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don’t need additional reassurances that you’re going to do something with a new cast of characters. I’d just as soon pass.;Lewis Thomas;family 20863;Wart hogs should sue for libel. It is a terrible name and they are fine fellows and devoted family men and it is rare to see one by himself the little woman and the kiddies are usually close at hand.;Ilka Chase;family 20864;You know, you only get one family, and you have to make it work.;Tori Spelling;family 20865;It’s a family that’s loaded with grudges and passion.

They are going to pick Mitt Romney.;John Sununu;family 20867;But in my heart of hearts, this is the kind of thing… this is what everyone is struggling with in their lives - relationships and family. To me, it’s always an interesting area to mine. I’m drawn to it.;Mark Ruffalo;family 20868;The U.K. needs a system for family migration underpinned by three simple principles.

And three: that they are able to integrate into British society.;Theresa May;family 20869;The sad events that occur in my life are the sad events that happen to everybody, with losing friends and family, but that is a natural occurrence, as natural as being born.;Sergio Aragones;family 20870;I have lived in Mumbai for more than 20 years, have my domicile here, my home and family here.;Shahrukh Khan;family 20871;I’ve been through a lot of things in my personal and family life.

I like to be there, near my family, my kids, also the real estate business I run with my wife.;Haile Gebrselassie;family 20873;A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company.

Who, with the right help are desperate to get off benefits, support their family and set an example for their children.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20847;Getting a family into work, supporting strong relationships, getting parents off drugs and out of debt - all this can do more for a child’s well-being than any amount of money in out-of-work benefits.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20848;Choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people.

I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.;Sophia Bush;family 20852;Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up.

He was unusual among his immediate family in that he was enormously cultured and had an incredible library.;Anthony Horowitz;family 20862;I don’t want to be reincarnated, that’s for sure.

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="I Know You Care’ is really personal and fragile for me. For me, it’s about losing a family member and also about a breakup. It’s about this idea of losing someone for good.;Ellie Goulding;family 20786;Getting and keeping my immunity became very important to me. For I needed to take care of myself and my family. No one else was worried about me.;Monica Lewinsky;family 20787;I was the black sheep of the family, and my mother never really understood me.;Andre Rieu;family 20788;Of course, I will continue to share my favorite Southern recipes, just like my mama, grandmother and family shared with me over the years. And now, I’ll be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes.;Paula Deen;family 20789;What we’ve tried to do is have neighbors, colleagues, friends and family talking.;David Plouffe;family 20790;Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live.;Hans-Georg Gadamer;family 20791;Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, brain and spinal cord disorders, diabetes, cancer, at least 58 diseases could potentially be cured through stem cell research, diseases that touch every family in America and in the world.;Rosa DeLauro;family 20792;When you go to the movies with your whole family, it’s a different experience. For some reason, it’s something that you’re all doing together and you take away something special in that.;Vin Diesel;family 20793;I was the oldest of the children in my family. I had to do a lot of diaper-changing and lunch-making. I was taking my little sister to ballet, picking up my brother, sort of being a super-nanny.;Vin Diesel;family 20794;And having a strong family, you know we’ve lost some members of our family and had some setbacks, but I think a good family and kids all those things I thought at one time… you got to be kidding me… Those things are so important they enable you to go on.;Brett Favre;family 20795;Well family is obviously the most important. There was a time when I thought football was the most important.;Brett Favre;family 20796;In spite of reports about playing with various teams, I’m enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football.;Brett Favre;family 20797;I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I’m the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I’m not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I’m just relaxing and enjoying it.;Betty White;family 20798;It’s a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That’s why it’s a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.;Betty White;family 20799;I’m thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.;Nicki Minaj;family 20800;When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that’s what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.;Leighton Meester;family 20801;My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don’t like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I’m not Nicki Minaj when I’m with them.;Nicki Minaj;family 20802;What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don’t write the book where it’s a conspiracy reaching the prime minister I don’t write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.;Harlan Coben;family 20803;A racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family.;Saul Alinsky;family 20804;Frankly I’m fairly boring or fairly busy. Between writing and family, I have little time for anything else.;Harlan Coben;family 20805;If I’m not writing well, I’m not happy. If I’m not spending enough time with my family, I’m not happy. If I’m not connecting to friends or if I don’t work out enough… You get the point. Everything has to be balanced. Nothing should be an extreme.;Harlan Coben;family 20806;I always wanted to be a farmer. There is a tradition of that in my family.;Bjork;family 20807;The Royal family to me are not England, and they are not the flag.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20808;My family, although they’re very large on both my parents’ sides, they don’t know much about their family tree. Occasionally, they try to dig, but they can’t get very far, and it’s baffling. In Dublin, it seems that so many public records were wiped out it’s proven to be very difficult, so I know very little.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family 20809;Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.;Heath Ledger;family 20810;I’m not sure why no one wants to admit there’s a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.;Tyler Perry;family 20811;Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20812;Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20813;Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20814;We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.;Jonathan Sacks;family 20815;I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry, because I don’t think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made, but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family 20816;No journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where I live. I don’t parade my family out for display, which is the way it will stay.;Tom Hanks;family 20817;I’ve always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I’d put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.;Emma Roberts;family 20818;We fight a lot, you know, but that’s family. We may be dysfunctional but we’re still family.;Star Jones;family 20819;I like all the families in the U.K. But what I like about the idea of the royal family is… they seem like they’re well educated and there’s something admirable about them. And the Queen… she reminds me of my grandma.;will.i.am;family 20820;I’m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I’ve been.;Tom Hardy;family 20821;If you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your family’s life but change your ghetto’s life, make your ghetto a good neighbourhood, learn science try to be like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.;will.i.am;family 20822;If you live in a good neighborhood, you drive home and there’s a bank. There’s grocery stores and big houses - but no motels. What that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house.;will.i.am;family 20823;Respectable means rich, and decent means poor. I should die if I heard my family called decent.;Thomas Mann;family 20824;The countries who do the best in international comparisons, whether it’s Finland or Japan, Denmark or Singapore, do well because they have professional teachers who are respected, and they also have family and community which support learning.;Howard Gardner;family 20825;The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality.;Talcott Parsons;family 20826;My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school. So I was always moving, I’m still always moving.;Gus Van Sant;family 20827;There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.;Gus Van Sant;family 20828;If I’m diagnosed with cancer I might become despondent, but someone young might not, and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent.;Gus Van Sant;family 20829;My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school.;Gus Van Sant;family 20830;Because I didn’t have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family.;Gus Van Sant;family 20831;According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.;Kit Bond;family 20832;I wasn’t looking to get into TV. My family was in the movie business, so I was never interested in that world.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20833;The summer before I went to culinary school, my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that I was making the right decision. I think they hoped I would change my mind about culinary school.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20834;My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I’m just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they’re older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20835;I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes. I don’t care if it’s a black family from Jamaica or a Hispanic family from Mexico. These issues need to be dealt with, but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way.;Harvey Weinstein;family 20836;A plague on eminence! I hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy, and I am stared at wherever I go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo and zoo animals have been known to die from stares.;Igor Stravinsky;family 20837;I’m a strange mixture of my mother’s curiosity my father, who grew up the son of the manse in a Presbyterian family, who had a tremendous sense of duty and responsibility and my mother’s father, who was always in trouble with gambling debts.;Rupert Murdoch;family 20838;I’m considered homophobic and crazy about these things and old fashioned. But I think that the family - father, mother, children - is fundamental to our civilisation.;Rupert Murdoch;family 20839;I’d be a liar if I said I had a normal family.;Edward Furlong;family 20840;I sometimes wonder if the tragedies my family has suffered are a kind of karmic price for all the fame and fortune the Bee Gees have had.;Robin Gibb;family 20841;In a couple, sometimes, one or both people have to give up their personal life, dreams and ambitions for the good of the family.;Monica Bellucci;family 20842;The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20843;When I’m on my own, I can be negative.

I think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople.;Jenson Button;family 20844;I do a lot of writing about my family.;Katey Sagal;family 20845;By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20846;I do not believe the picture that some people paint of Scottish towns dependent on welfare. Every time I come here, I meet people who are determined to get into work. Who, with the right help are desperate to get off benefits, support their family and set an example for their children.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20847;Getting a family into work, supporting strong relationships, getting parents off drugs and out of debt - all this can do more for a child’s well-being than any amount of money in out-of-work benefits.;Iain Duncan Smith;family 20848;Choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people. It was a way to choose a new family.;Juliette Binoche;family 20849;The extraordinary thing about India is that it’s such a family place. It’s full of families everywhere.;Danny Boyle;family 20850;God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine.;Jerry Falwell;family 20851;I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it’s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home.

I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family 20835;I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes.

I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.;Sophia Bush;family 20852;Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up.

20834;My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I’m just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they’re older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family
20835;I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes. I don’t care if it’s a black family from Jamaica or a Hispanic family from Mexico.

20852;Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it’s like you don’t ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it’s kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.;Sophia Bush;family
20853;Family is becoming more and more important to me.;Diane Kruger;family

20864;You know, you only get one family, and you have to make it work.;Tori Spelling;family

20873;A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company. We don’t isolate the family. We don’t make rides that say, ‘Hey mom, dad, you go sit on the bench.</p>
