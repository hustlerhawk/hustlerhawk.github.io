It means vote what’s right for humanity.;Macklemore;equality 17235;We will have bigger bureaucracies, bigger labor unions, and bigger state-run corporations. It will be harder to be an entrepreneur because of punitive taxes and regulations. The rewards of success will be expropriated for the sake of attaining greater income equality.;Arthur C. Brooks;equality 17236;It will appear evident upon attentive consideration that equality of intellectual and physical advantages is the only sure foundation of liberty, and that such equality may best, and perhaps only, be obtained by a union of interests and cooperation in labor.;Francis Wright;equality 17237;When I look at my daughter, who’s 24, she is much more confident than I ever was and her expectations are higher. But I worry that there is a backlash brewing against progress on equality.;Frances O’Grady;equality 17238;Do people really want liberty, equality, fraternity?

A democratic monarchy: equality before consumption, fraternity in consumption, and freedom through consumption.;Raoul Vaneigem;equality 17245;The work that must be done for each woman to reconnect with her psyche and to give herself a chance to live her own life is essentially the same. The realization of the equality of all races, the equality of all beings is essential.;Betty Buckley;equality 17246;Propelled by freedom of faith, gender equality and economic justice for all, India will become a modern nation. Minor blemishes cannot cloak the fact that India is becoming such a modern nation: no faith is in danger in our country, and the continuing commitment to gender equality is one of the great narratives of our times.;Pranab Mukherjee;equality 17247;I would point out that Japan’s proposal at the Versailles Peace Conference on the principle of racial equality was rejected by delegates such as those from Britain and the United States.;Hideki Tojo;equality 17248;Such security is equal liberty.

Higgins;equality 17252;The history of the past is but one long struggle upward to equality.;Elizabeth Cady Stanton;equality 17253;In a society in which equality is a fact, not merely a word, words of racial or sexual assault and humiliation will be nonsense syllables.;Catharine MacKinnon;equality 17254;The basis, the corner-stone of this Government, was the perfect equality of the free, sovereign, and independent States which made it.;Robert Toombs;equality 17255;Give us equality of enjoyment, equal right to expansion - it is as necessary to our prosperity as yours.;Robert Toombs;equality 17256;The March on Washington affirmed our values as a people: equality and opportunity for all. Forty-one years ago, during a time of segregation, these were an ideal.;Leonard Boswell;equality 17257;Well, my personal mission statement is that we want marriage equality in all 50 states. We want it not to be a state-by-state issue. We don’t want it to be something the majority is voting on. I don’t think the civil rights of any minority should be in the hands of any majority.;Jesse Tyler Ferguson;equality 17258;As an actor, you just want to work, and then you just want to be on a show or have a job that you love, and you hope that job will last - those things have happened.

It is an issue I live every day.;Hilary Rosen;equality 17263;I said on the equality side of it, that it is essential to a woman’s equality with man that she be the decision-maker, that her choice be controlling.;Ruth Bader Ginsburg;equality 17264;Earlier feminists were almost universally pro-choice and have dominated political debate until now. Having access to abortion was viewed as the only way women could have full equality with men, who, until recently, couldn’t get pregnant.;Kathleen Parker;equality 17265;A formally recognized equality does, however, accord the smaller nations a position which they should be able to use increasingly in the interest of humanity as a whole and in the service of the ideal.;Hjalmar Branting;equality 17266;The equality among all members of the League, which is provided in the statutes giving each state only one vote, cannot of course abolish the actual material inequality of the powers concerned.;Hjalmar Branting;equality 17267;It wouldn’t be fair to say that conservatives cherish property the way liberals cherish equality.

You got to keep doing it.;Christopher Cross;equality 17275;I joined the Labour party because I believed in equality, in freedom of speech and in tolerance, compassion and understanding for people, irrespective of their background and views. In whatever I decide to do in the future I will hold to those principles.;Geoff Hoon;equality 17276;Obviously, my life and my job in 2010 is very different from Peggy’s experience in the 1960s.
