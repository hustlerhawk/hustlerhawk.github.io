It was from my imagination that the characters in my story would emerge.;Amy Waldman;imagination 37925;Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head.

They come with such a lack of cynicism.;Michelle Forbes;imagination 37942;We didn’t have television until I was about eight years old, so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television, you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things, and the comics, that I immersed myself in as a child.;Jessica Hagedorn;imagination 37943;Grandchildren have taught me how important the future is.

Salvatore;imagination 37923;People who think my books are autobiographical, which they’re not, credit me with having a much better memory than I do.

It was from my imagination that the characters in my story would emerge.;Amy Waldman;imagination 37925;Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head.

I know a lot of people don’t like working with children. I actually adore it, because you watch their imagination open up and you watch them start to learn this job that I’ve been doing for so long. They come with such a lack of cynicism.;Michelle Forbes;imagination 37942;We didn’t have television until I was about eight years old, so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television, you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things, and the comics, that I immersed myself in as a child.;Jessica Hagedorn;imagination 37943;Grandchildren have taught me how important the future is.

That really does take a huge imagination.;Richard Lugar;imagination 37944;Catastrophes are often stimulated by the failure to feel the emergence of a domain, and so what cannot be felt in the imagination is experienced as embodied sensation in the catastrophe.;William Irwin Thompson;imagination 37945;George has only got to ring me. His imagination is so wonderful, I’d do any character he might create.;Peter Mayhew;imagination 37946;I don’t know if Jim was a major part of that or not.

They come with such a lack of cynicism.;Michelle Forbes;imagination 37942;We didn't have television until I was about eight years old, so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television, you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things, and the comics, that I immersed myself in as a child.;Jessica Hagedorn;imagination 37943;Grandchildren have taught me how important the future is.

His imagination is so wonderful, I'd do any character he might create.;Peter Mayhew;imagination 37946;I don't know if Jim was a major part of that or not.
