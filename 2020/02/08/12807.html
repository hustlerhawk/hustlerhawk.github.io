To me, to be on the red carpet is the best place in the world.;Steven Cojocaru;dreams 15531;The old studios that mass-produced dreams are gone with the wind, just like the old downtown theaters that were the temples of the dreams.;Suzanne Fields;dreams 15532;This city can be kind of brutal, so you see your dreams from every different angle, but ultimately it’s about acting and if you enjoy acting, you will always enjoy acting.;Radha Mitchell;dreams 15533;In my lifetime, I’ve discovered a great many incredibly talented individuals. Some have achieved stardom. Simultaneously, I’ve seen many dreams shattered, egos destroyed and lives changed forever. The end destination may well be fame and fortune, but the road to stardom is littered with broken hearts.;Nigel Lythgoe;dreams 15534;Youth is in a grand flush, like the hot days of ending summer and pleasant dreams thrall your spirit, like the smoky atmosphere that bathes the landscape of an August day.;Donald G. Mitchell;dreams 15535;Dreams are, by definition, cursed with short life spans.;Candice Bergen;dreams 15536;If you want to achieve your dreams, you must follow them, and the best way to follow them is not to think about wanting to be very rich, but to think about doing something that you really want to do.;Jackie Collins;dreams 15537;My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings.;Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley;dreams 15538;In Dreams… well, I was slightly overcompensating with that.

And yeah, I was almost shocked in the moment that it all came together so nicely.;Roger Federer;dreams 15545;Dream study impacts culture. We are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams.

You apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life.;Henry Reed;dreams 15548;People are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another’s dreams.

You know, the guilty girl being pursued, falling, all kinds of stuff that we see in our dreams all the time.;Brian De Palma;dreams 15553;I always wanted to be a Californian. In my wildest dreams, I always liked California - it’s the place where oranges grows on trees! Fruit just falls off the trees.;Eric Burdon;dreams 15554;You can’t censor people’s dreams.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15555;I thin many people’s deviant behavior starts with dreams because dreams are so non-linear… as if there’s an assumption that everything has to be linear or has to be plotted.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15556;Dreams are a scientific fact.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15557;It is an everlasting desire to make my dreams come true. And it’s getting to the point now where it’s like, come on I want my dreams to come true so that I can get on with the rest of my life. Sometimes I think about the rest of my life when I’m done.;Picabo Street;dreams 15558;One of my dreams in life is to do fund-raising for the youth.;Picabo Street;dreams 15559;Anderson Cooper every night dreams about getting my job permanently really.;Regis Philbin;dreams 15560;So, I think that Marilyn, what she gave the world, and in many ways Kennedy too, was that they had dreams and they didn’t allow anybody to take away their dreams.;Sally Kirkland;dreams 15561;It’s weird to say, but every time I look at my daughter and I see this little living breathing thing that came from me, that represents all of the hopes and dreams that I would want for her, I see a miracle.;Josh Gad;dreams 15562;My dreams are of water.

If it’s not received, great, I respect you for not.;Octavia Spencer;dreams 15566;I was always a closet lover of acting. My mom was very practical.

And she said, ‘Maybe not that’.;Octavia Spencer;dreams 15567;My career was full of struggles and dreams, disappointments and peaks and valleys. But there was no Twitter, no Facebook or TMZ. Young actors could make mistakes and not become the focus of tabloids.;Ricky Schroder;dreams 15568;It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world.

It was dangled as a carrot. In terms of people’s hopes and dreams, to say that that is less of a reality than the daily grind they find themselves in is maybe not correct.;Martin Mull;dreams 15572;Screenplays I didn’t really care about, journalism, travel books, getting my writer friends to write about their dreams or something.

To me, as well as being a real place, it’s a place where people go to find something - to find happiness or to realize their dreams. So it has that kind of quality of heroism and heartache, and Australia has that, as well.;Colin Hay;dreams 15590;America is not just a democracy, it represents a certain culture of competitive mobility and personality aspirations, politics is not merely a clash of interests, but a clash of dreams.;David Brooks;dreams 15591;I knew I wanted to do something creative.

You apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life.;Henry Reed;dreams 15548;People are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another’s dreams.

In my wildest dreams, I always liked California - it’s the place where oranges grows on trees!
