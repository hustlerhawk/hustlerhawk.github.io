But an instant’s thought shows that Afghanistan is being, if anything, bombed out of the Stone Age.;Christopher Hitchens;age 399;Oh, if I had been loved at the age of seventeen, what an idiot I would be today. Happiness is like smallpox: if you catch it too soon, it can completely ruin your constitution.;Gustave Flaubert;age 400;English people don’t have very good diction. In France you have to pronounce very particularly and clearly, and learning French at an early age helped me enormously.;Vivien Leigh;age 401;Children also have artistic ability, and there is wisdom in there having it! The more helpless they are, the more instructive are the examples they furnish us and they must be preserved free of corruption from an early age.;Paul Klee;age 402;Of course, the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age.;Jennifer Aniston;age 403;You know what makes me feel old?

So it’s not that difficult to unpack a bit of grief from some little corner of your heart and cry over it.;Emma Thompson;age 410;My mother enjoyed old age, and because of her I’ve begun to enjoy parts of it too. So far I’ve had it good and am crumbling nicely.;Lionel Blue;age 411;We’re saying no changes for Medicare for people above the age of 55. And in order to keep the promise to current seniors who’ve already retired and organized their lives around this program, you have to reform it for the next generation.;Paul Ryan;age 412;It’s sad, actually, because my anxiety keeps me from enjoying things as much as I should at this age.;Amanda Seyfried;age 413;I felt a tremendous sadness for men who can’t deal with a woman of their own age.;Michael Caine;age 414;This is the first convention of the space age - where a candidate can promise the moon and mean it.;David Brinkley;age 415;Revenge is the naked idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age.;Percy Bysshe Shelley;age 416;I think I don’t regret a single ‘excess’ of my responsive youth - I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and possibilities I didn’t embrace.;Henry James;age 417;Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today’s job with yesterday’s tools and yesterday’s concepts.;Marshall McLuhan;age 418;I’ll tell you, there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer. I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age.;Salma Hayek;age 419;Man arrives as a novice at each age of his life.;Nicolas Chamfort;age 420;Live your life and forget your age.;Jean Paul;age 421;I can’t look in the mirror and look at fake things. I just can’t. I’d rather age.;Heidi Klum;age 422;The surest sign of age is loneliness.;Annie Dillard;age 423;Learning to dislike children at an early age saves a lot of expense and aggravation later in life.;Robert Byrne;age 424;Confidence is something you’re born with. I know I had loads of it even at the age of 15.;Hedy Lamarr;age 425;We accumulate our opinions at an age when our understanding is at its weakest.;Georg C. Lichtenberg;age 426;I got to experience soccer at the highest level at a young age I decided I wanted to be part of that for as long as possible.;Mia Hamm;age 427;Living in an age of advertisement, we are perpetually disillusioned.

Only some of us never grow out of it.;Peter Ustinov;age 437;My inspiration was my mom. She’s a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.;Emeril Lagasse;age 438;The great book for you is the book that has the most to say to you at the moment when you are reading. I do not mean the book that is most instructive, but the book that feeds your spirit. And that depends on your age, your experience, your psychological and spiritual need.;Robertson Davies;age 439;Age gives you a great sense of proportion.

Sometimes you never remember to actually get happy.;John Mayer;age 445;Being a father at a later age is different from when I had my other two daughters when I was in my 20s and 30s. If you’re in your 60s and you’re with the kid every day, you’re dealing with the mind of a child, so it opens up that childishness in you again.;Martin Scorsese;age 446;A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.;Jawaharlal Nehru;age 447;There is nothing in socialism that a little age or a little money will not cure.;Will Durant;age 448;If you age with somebody, you go through so many roles - you’re lovers, friends, enemies, colleagues, strangers you’re brother and sister. That’s what intimacy is, if you’re with your soulmate.;Cate Blanchett;age 449;With age, you see people fail more. You see yourself fail more. How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid? You keep going. Luckily, I’m not afraid to make a fool of myself.;Hugh Jackman;age 450;I’m not skinny for the wrong reasons. It’s not because I’m bulimic or anorexic or doing drugs.
