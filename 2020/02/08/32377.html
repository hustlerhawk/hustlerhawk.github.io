He’s in his imagination, writing these stories of murder.;Nathan Fillion;imagination 37721;I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that’s cool.;Nathan Fillion;imagination 37722;I like to have a thing suggested rather than told in full. When every detail is given, the mind rests satisfied, and the imagination loses the desire to use its own wings.;Thomas Bailey Aldrich;imagination 37723;Toy Soldiers was my introduction to film. I certainly didn’t think I was doing art by any stretch of the imagination.;Tim Robbins;imagination 37724;There’s the argument that you can relate to someone who’s completely unrelatable.

My imagination needs reality like a blind man needs a cane.;Tom Waits;imagination 37729;The higher the artist, the fewer the gestures. The fewer the tools, the greater the imagination.

In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.;Ai Weiwei;imagination 37744;I suppose I’m proudest of my novels for what’s imagined in them. I think the world of my imagination is a richer and more interesting place than my personal biography.;John Irving;imagination 37745;A clever, imagination, humorous request can open closed doors and closed minds.;Percy Ross;imagination 37746;I’ve been working on the soprano saxophone for 40 years, and the possibilities are astounding.
