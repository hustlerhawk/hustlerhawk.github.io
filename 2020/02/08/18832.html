The answer to that question will determine whether the society is a free society or a fear society.;Natan Sharansky;fear 22683;Amin knew that neither West nor East would criticize him for fear that he would support the other side. He felt he was untouchable and he said so openly.;Ryszard Kapuscinski;fear 22684;I have no doubt that given a real choice, the vast majority of Muslims and Arabs, like everyone else will choose a free society over a fear society.;Natan Sharansky;fear 22685;I’m always interested in trying to investigate different personalities. I want to keep myself guessing and keep the fear element alive, so that I don’t get too comfortable.;Michael Fassbender;fear 22686;Only weeks after Oslo began, when nearly all the world and most of Israel was drunk with the idea of peace, I argued that a Palestinian society not constrained by democratic norms would be a fear society that would pose a grave threat to Israel.;Natan Sharansky;fear 22687;I fear it’s because religion is man’s attempt to reach God, and when he feels he has succeeded, he cannot abide anyone else’s claim to have done the same.;Jerry B.

We give our best.;Rickie Lee Jones;fear 22689;People feel uncomfortable talking about racial issues out of fear that if they express things, they will be characterized in a way that’s not fair.

Maybe it’s the fear of getting in an elevator maybe it’s the fear of going on a plane and seeing the world.;Criss Angel;fear 22691;I approach my character with the question: What would an animal think? How would an animal respond? A lot of times, it’s quick action and no fear, and sometimes it’s irrational fear. You don’t always know.;Victoria Pratt;fear 22692;I think that the problem is that people fear so many things and they don’t live life to its fullest. And for me as an artist, if God should want me to come this Wednesday to the end of my life, so be it.;Criss Angel;fear 22693;You can’t be afraid to put out a fire if you’re a fireman.

It was quite an enlightened sort of move. You could go to this government bureau with scripts and and get finance for films.;Bruce Beresford;finance 22833;I’ve learned there’s a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short-seller.
