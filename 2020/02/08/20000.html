All of us have done something we regret - how we manage to remove that from our conscience, or whether that’s even possible, interested me.;Ian Mcewan;forgiveness 24176;Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend.;Jewel;forgiveness 24177;Well, I’ve never left my faith - but have I made a lot of mistakes? But was I fortunate that I was brought up in that Pentecostal church, where I heard about God’s love and God’s forgiveness.;Billy Ray Cyrus;forgiveness 24178;On the Day of Atonement, Jews are commanded to seek forgiveness from the people we have hurt.;Laura Schlessinger;forgiveness 24179;The Dalai Lama’s entire being is about peace and harmony, forgiveness and self-discipline.

D. Jakes;forgiveness 24182;I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior. I believe that Jesus died for my sins, and rose again, and that’s my belief. I still don’t know what ‘Christian’ means. I’m a follower of Christ, but I keep making a whole bunch of mistakes.

It was my fault and, you know, no matter what went on, the man has to take responsibility and I do.;Jim Bakker;forgiveness 24185;Well, of course I think people can be forgiven.

My only hope is that some good can come out of my situation.;Jayson Blair;forgiveness 24190;I’m a lapsed Quaker. I don’t go to meetings any more. But I’m very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter.

I think they think it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.;Cheryl Hines;forgiveness 24193;I would say that playing this character has caused me to think about a lot of things.

It’s a strange truth, but forgiveness is a painful and difficult process. It’s not something that happens overnight.

That’s democracy, liberty, individual freedom. China sooner or later has to go that way. It cannot go backward.;Dalai Lama;freedom 24303;Punk is musical freedom.
