      <a href="/2020/02/08/9103" class="pagination--pager" title="Sparkle’ fell into my lap. I had heard a little bit about it, that it was being redone in early 2011. I was just kind of like, ‘Oh, that would be really cool,’ and not really thinking too much about it, and then it came through my agency. I read it, I fell in love with the script and I went in to audition.;Jordin Sparks;cool 10817;As far as friendships go, things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I’m like, ‘Oh my goodness gracious - that’s so insane.’ I also have friends who are just doing their own thing, which is cool.;Jordin Sparks;cool 10818;It’s cool to have parents and family who will always tell me the truth no matter what. They’ll tell me if I’m doing something stupid!;Jordin Sparks;cool 10819;I have the ability to sing with emotion and feeling, but if you say I sound like Billie Holiday, that’s cool. Let’s look at who Billie was: she was this person, this singer, this beautiful diva who could move the audience with the slightest gesture of her hand.;Erykah Badu;cool 10820;Oh, man, if in real life I was as cool and suave as Coach Taylor and had all the answers, things would be easier.;Kyle Chandler;cool 10821;I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels, I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes. I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.;Anne Hathaway;cool 10822;It was just an idea I had, that it could be cool to have a book covered in fake fur.;Dave Eggers;cool 10823;I’m cool with the way I look, I’m not an ugly dog, but I don’t see myself as a stud or anything.;Seann William Scott;cool 10824;I’ve never been cool and I don’t really care about being cool. It’s just an awful lot of time and hair gel wasted.;Chris Martin;cool 10825;For my group of friends is Lady Gaga eye-opening? No. She’s a less dangerous version of what was so cool about pop culture in the ’80s. Back then it was so gay and so punk in so many ways.;Beth Ditto;cool 10826;All this fashion stuff - who’s cool now - is just a bigger version of the cool kids versus the nerds.;Beth Ditto;cool 10827;I think it’s really cool that there are people like Adele on the cover of ‘Vogue’ and ‘Rolling Stone,’ and like I think it’s really important that people are talking about your body, because if they don’t, then you’ll never be able to break that barrier.;Beth Ditto;cool 10828;I think all jocks have a sensitive side. It’s just, will they show it to anybody? Will they let their guard down and stop being tough and the cool jock guy around their friends, or just relax? I don’t know if it’s best to say opening up, but just relax and really say what you’re actually thinking, and not what you think people want to hear.;Channing Tatum;cool 10829;Whatever hysteria exists is inflamed by mystery, suspicion and secrecy. Hard and exact facts will cool it.;Elia Kazan;cool 10830;I want to go to college and go back to Georgetown. It’s a really cool place.;Bobby Flay;cool 10831;I haven’t ever really relied on relationships with guys. They come around and it’s cool, but it’s never been a big thing. I guess I’ve just been really distracted by work.;Leighton Meester;cool 10832;If we have a great idea, we’ll go, ‘Oh, this could be a cool movie.’ Or really for us, it’s more like, ‘Oh, this is a really bad idea. Let’s do this. This seems really stupid.
