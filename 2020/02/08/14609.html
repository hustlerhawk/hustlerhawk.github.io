They are crows, daws, and starlings that flock together.;John Webster;alone 1772;I like being alone and I think this movie, as much as it is an investigation of connection and people bonding, I also think it’s just as much about loneliness.;Jason Schwartzman;alone 1773;I am very averse to bringing myself forward in print, but as my account will only appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can hardly accuse myself of a personal intrusion.;Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley;alone 1774;The secret to being a writer is that you have to write. It’s not enough to think about writing or to study literature or plan a future life as an author. You really have to lock yourself away, alone, and get to work.;Augusten Burroughs;alone 1775;When I was old enough to go to movies alone, I got to see ‘Frankenstein’ and ‘Dracula’ on the big screen. I just fell in love with them.;George A. Romero;alone 1776;Autobiography begins with a sense of being alone. It is an orphan form.;John Berger;alone 1777;Young people discovering their sexuality must know they walk with a strong tradition and that they are not alone.

He’s the center of a team - doctors, scientists, coaches, agents and so on.;Emil Zatopek;alone 1780;I don’t treat the band like I’m above them or that they’re a hired hand for me. We’ve never worked that way. So I’m a team player. I would be very uncomfortable having to do this alone.;Tom Petty;alone 1781;It is said that man doesn’t live by bread alone. Sometimes this is unfortunate, because people who cannot live by bread alone too often kill other people in consequence of the fights they get into.;John McCarthy;alone 1782;For an adult, eating alone at McDonald’s is admitting a kind of defeat.;Jonathan Carroll;alone 1783;I tour alone. There’s no sound check, no back up. I stay with the hosts I am in a family home and it’s really nourishing. I just have to remember after the show not to run out into the living room in my pyjamas. Every day, it’s a new relationship being built. It’s odd and wonderful.;Jane Siberry;alone 1784;I hope this will help new moms not feel alone or desperate, and that there is no shame in their feelings. PPD is out of their control, but the treatment and healing process is not.;Brooke Shields;alone 1785;It’s good that the first half of the speech emphasized freedom, because George W. Bush has been the global champion for freedom. As he said, if we don’t fight tyranny it will not leave us alone in peace.;Ernest Istook;alone 1786;All my fans tell me what a glamorous life I have, but I tell them how hard I work and how many nights I spend alone with my dogs, eating chicken pot pie in my bedroom.;Shannen Doherty;alone 1787;I’ve been left alone, even by the paparazzi, because what sells is sex and scandal. Absent that, they really don’t have much interest in you. I’m still married, still working, still happy.;Matt Damon;alone 1788;Although born in a prosperous realm, we did not believe that its boundaries should limit our knowledge, and that the lore of the East should alone enlighten us.;Charles de Secondat;alone 1789;Science and vision are not opposites or even at odds.

In fact, I’ve talked about this with therapists, especially if you’re talking about a relationship, because when you’re with somebody, you’re going to your family, and she’s alone.;Gary Allan;alone 1792;I mean one of the things about being alone is that you’ve no people to define yourself off, I mean, people are like all-round mirrors, because let’s face it, we don’t often see ourselves all round in a mirror anyway, do we.;Diana Wynne Jones;alone 1793;The devil had as good have let Paul alone, for he no sooner comes into prison but he falls a preaching, at which the gates of Satan’s prison fly open, and poor sinners come forth.;William Gurnall;alone 1794;Every three days on average, I am alone on stage, facing the public.;Placido Domingo;alone 1795;But in the end, in the end one is alone.

He fears being alone, without allies.;Meir Kahane;alone 1797;I think that in itself is kind of an amazing achievement to be able to say that your full-time career is in any creative arts, let alone a show that has kept people interested for coming on four seasons and hopefully more.;Anna Paquin;alone 1798;In today’s interdependent world, a threat to one becomes a menace to all. And no state can defeat these challenges and threats alone.;Michelle Bachelet;alone 1799;Artists walk alone.;Ezra Miller;alone 1800;Christmas lights may be the loneliest thing for me, especially if you mix them up with reindeers and sleighs. I feel alone. I feel isolated. I feel I do not belong.;Mira Nair;alone 1801;In my cranky old age, I actually prefer recording alone now, on ‘The Simpsons,’ for example, because I find that the director can just focus on what I’m doing and I can do a lot of variations.

Very alone.;Yves Saint Laurent;alone 1803;It felt like the first thing, but when I first started out, I got a job adapting a book by Russell Banks called ‘Rule Of The Bone.’ I didn’t do a very good job. I didn’t really know what I was doing in general, let alone how to adapt a book.;Paul Thomas Anderson;alone 1804;Let me alone: I have yet my legs and one arm. Tell the surgeon to make haste and his instruments. I know I must lose my right arm, so the sooner it’s off the better.;Horatio Nelson;alone 1805;On the stage, you alone hold the key, and on the night you have to trust that the director has inspired you enough to take the material and run with it.;Greta Scacchi;alone 1806;We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true.

I need to inspire them the best way I can.;Alonzo Mourning;alone 1816;This communication alone, by the comparison of the antagonisms, rivalries, movements which give birth to decisive moments, permits the evolution of the soul, whereby a man realizes himself on earth.

Ellis;alone 1826;As the only girl growing up among three brothers, I was always afraid of being excluded.

I think it’s funny! I think it’s funny! I go, what? It’s so absurd. I’m alone.;Danny DeVito;alone 1829;I personally love to run outdoor fitness trails.

I don’t seek out writers because we all want to be alone.;Patricia Highsmith;alone 1846;We are the only class in history that has been left to fight its battles alone, unaided by the ruling powers.

But my mom and I get alone really well - obviously, because my mom and my dad get along so well.;Jenna Bush;alone 1848;As I’ve gotten older I’ve occasionally found myself nostalgic for earlier periods of solitude, though I realize that’s also likely a false nostalgia, as I know there was nothing I wanted more during those periods than to not be alone, whatever that means.;Chris Ware;alone 1849;He alone loves the Creator perfectly who manifests a pure love for his neighbor.;Venerable Bede;alone 1850;For every five well-adjusted and smoothly functioning Americans, there are two who never had the chance to discover themselves.

Therefore chemistry alone will not explain life’s origin, any more than a study of silicon, copper and plastic will explain how a computer can execute a program.;Paul Davies;alone 1857;Perhaps the best motivation for going to Mars is political.

This alone is real justice, and of course such justice is necessarily free.;Benjamin Tucker;alone 1860;Sisters are always drying their hair. Locked into rooms, alone, they pose at the mirror, shoulders bare, trying this way and that their hair, or fly importunate down the stair to answer the telephone.;Phyllis McGinley;alone 1861;We’ll try to include Iraqi officers in our staffs.

Fear is that thing that just keeps you closed down, and quite frankly, alone.;Andrew Shue;alone 1864;The White House alone cannot hold its opponents accountable.;Paul Weyrich;alone 1865;Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque. But just doing it - being in your room for years on end, locked in your head, alone with invented ghosts - it weakens and softens the body. And I know I can’t just live in my head.;Tony Parsons;alone 1866;However, democracy cannot be defined as the existence of parliaments and elections alone.;Recep Tayyip Erdogan;alone 1867;But Socialism, alone, can bring self-determination of their peoples.;Karl Liebknecht;alone 1868;By being friends with all, we are not alone.;Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa;alone 1869;No man is an island.
