      <a href="/2020/02/08/358" class="pagination--pager" title="Bombing Afghanistan back into the Stone Age’ was quite a favourite headline for some wobbly liberals. The slogan does all the work. But an instant’s thought shows that Afghanistan is being, if anything, bombed out of the Stone Age.;Christopher Hitchens;age 399;Oh, if I had been loved at the age of seventeen, what an idiot I would be today. Happiness is like smallpox: if you catch it too soon, it can completely ruin your constitution.;Gustave Flaubert;age 400;English people don’t have very good diction. In France you have to pronounce very particularly and clearly, and learning French at an early age helped me enormously.;Vivien Leigh;age 401;Children also have artistic ability, and there is wisdom in there having it! The more helpless they are, the more instructive are the examples they furnish us and they must be preserved free of corruption from an early age.;Paul Klee;age 402;Of course, the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age.;Jennifer Aniston;age 403;You know what makes me feel old? When I see girls who are 20-something, or the new crop of actresses, and think, Aren’t we kind of the same age?;Jennifer Aniston;age 404;I think love can happen at any age… it has no age.;Shahrukh Khan;age 405;Elizabeth Peyton, the artist known for tiny, dazzling portraits of radiant youth, is now painting tiny, dazzling portraits of radiant middle age.;Jerry Saltz;age 406;I’m inspired by people who keep on rolling, no matter their age.;Jimmy Buffett;age 407;By Time and Age full many things are taught.;Aeschylus;age 408;I was taught from a young age that I had to serve, so that turned into me thinking I had to save the planet.;Alanis Morissette;age 409;If you’ve got to my age, you’ve probably had your heart broken many times. So it’s not that difficult to unpack a bit of grief from some little corner of your heart and cry over it.;Emma Thompson;age 410;My mother enjoyed old age, and because of her I’ve begun to enjoy parts of it too. So far I’ve had it good and am crumbling nicely.;Lionel Blue;age 411;We’re saying no changes for Medicare for people above the age of 55. And in order to keep the promise to current seniors who’ve already retired and organized their lives around this program, you have to reform it for the next generation.;Paul Ryan;age 412;It’s sad, actually, because my anxiety keeps me from enjoying things as much as I should at this age.;Amanda Seyfried;age 413;I felt a tremendous sadness for men who can’t deal with a woman of their own age.;Michael Caine;age 414;This is the first convention of the space age - where a candidate can promise the moon and mean it.;David Brinkley;age 415;Revenge is the naked idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age.;Percy Bysshe Shelley;age 416;I think I don’t regret a single ‘excess’ of my responsive youth - I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and possibilities I didn’t embrace.;Henry James;age 417;Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today’s job with yesterday’s tools and yesterday’s concepts.;Marshall McLuhan;age 418;I’ll tell you, there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer. I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age.;Salma Hayek;age 419;Man arrives as a novice at each age of his life.;Nicolas Chamfort;age 420;Live your life and forget your age.;Jean Paul;age 421;I can’t look in the mirror and look at fake things. I just can’t. I’d rather age.;Heidi Klum;age 422;The surest sign of age is loneliness.;Annie Dillard;age 423;Learning to dislike children at an early age saves a lot of expense and aggravation later in life.;Robert Byrne;age 424;Confidence is something you’re born with. I know I had loads of it even at the age of 15.;Hedy Lamarr;age 425;We accumulate our opinions at an age when our understanding is at its weakest.;Georg C. Lichtenberg;age 426;I got to experience soccer at the highest level at a young age I decided I wanted to be part of that for as long as possible.;Mia Hamm;age 427;Living in an age of advertisement, we are perpetually disillusioned. The perfect life is spread before us every day, but it changes and withers at a touch.;J. B. Priestley;age 428;Age, like distance lends a double charm.;Oliver Herford;age 429;Utility is the great idol of the age, to which all powers must do service and all talents swear allegiance.;Friedrich Schiller;age 430;Anyone who writes an autobiographical work at the age of 34 is, at best, presumptuous. It occurred to me that it was time to set the record straight.;Jessica Savitch;age 431;New needs need new techniques.

H. Auden;age 435;I think it’s pretty crazy to say you’ve been typecast at the age of 20 before you’ve even really started getting going.;Tom Felton;age 436;At the age of four with paper hats and wooden swords we’re all Generals. Only some of us never grow out of it.;Peter Ustinov;age 437;My inspiration was my mom. She’s a great cook, and she still cooks, and we still banter back and forth about cooking. Growing up in a mostly Portuguese community, food was important and the family table was extremely important. At a very young age I understood that.;Emeril Lagasse;age 438;The great book for you is the book that has the most to say to you at the moment when you are reading. I do not mean the book that is most instructive, but the book that feeds your spirit. And that depends on your age, your experience, your psychological and spiritual need.;Robertson Davies;age 439;Age gives you a great sense of proportion. You can be very hard on yourself when you’re younger but now I just think ‘well everybody’s absolutely mad and I’m doing quite well’.;Steven Morrissey;age 440;If the nineteenth century was the age of the editorial chair, ours is the century of the psychiatrist’s couch.;Marshall McLuhan;age 441;American youth attributes much more importance to arriving at driver’s license age than at voting age.;Marshall McLuhan;age 442;I think a child should be allowed to take his father’s or mother’s name at will on coming of age.

Sometimes you never remember to actually get happy.;John Mayer;age 445;Being a father at a later age is different from when I had my other two daughters when I was in my 20s and 30s. If you’re in your 60s and you’re with the kid every day, you’re dealing with the mind of a child, so it opens up that childishness in you again.;Martin Scorsese;age 446;A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.;Jawaharlal Nehru;age 447;There is nothing in socialism that a little age or a little money will not cure.;Will Durant;age 448;If you age with somebody, you go through so many roles - you’re lovers, friends, enemies, colleagues, strangers you’re brother and sister. That’s what intimacy is, if you’re with your soulmate.;Cate Blanchett;age 449;With age, you see people fail more. You see yourself fail more. How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid? You keep going. Luckily, I’m not afraid to make a fool of myself.;Hugh Jackman;age 450;I’m not skinny for the wrong reasons. It’s not because I’m bulimic or anorexic or doing drugs. Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I’m actually overweight.;Lindsay Lohan;age 451;It seems that when you get to a certain age you almost give yourself permission to misbehave and say what you think.

I’m feeling my age and I’ve ordered the Ferrari.

He is a researcher. I see myself that way.;David Hockney;age 460;I lived the true American dream, because I was able to pursue what I set as my goals at a very young age.;Mario Andretti;age 461;Everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age. I don’t notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70.;Vivienne Westwood;age 462;Photography suits the temper of this age - of active bodies and minds. It is a perfect medium for one whose mind is teeming with ideas, imagery, for a prolific worker who would be slowed down by painting or sculpting, for one who sees quickly and acts decisively, accurately.;Edward Weston;age 463;I never - you know also one of the things that would save me for a man my age, it was not that easy to lose that much weight and fall down and look like something draped.;Karl Lagerfeld;age 464;I wish I’d gotten sober at a younger age.;Janice Dickinson;age 465;Middle Age is that perplexing time of life when we hear two voices calling us, one saying, ‘Why not?’ and the other, ‘Why bother?
