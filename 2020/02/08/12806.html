I worked on Bobby Kennedy’s campaign for president as a teenager in California and the night he was killed.;David Talbot;dreams 15528;Happiness is making your dreams come true.;Jourdan Dunn;dreams 15529;I want to keep my dreams, even bad ones, because without them, I might have nothing all night long.;Joseph Heller;dreams 15530;I am a child of Hollywood and dreams. To me, to be on the red carpet is the best place in the world.;Steven Cojocaru;dreams 15531;The old studios that mass-produced dreams are gone with the wind, just like the old downtown theaters that were the temples of the dreams.;Suzanne Fields;dreams 15532;This city can be kind of brutal, so you see your dreams from every different angle, but ultimately it’s about acting and if you enjoy acting, you will always enjoy acting.;Radha Mitchell;dreams 15533;In my lifetime, I’ve discovered a great many incredibly talented individuals. Some have achieved stardom. Simultaneously, I’ve seen many dreams shattered, egos destroyed and lives changed forever. The end destination may well be fame and fortune, but the road to stardom is littered with broken hearts.;Nigel Lythgoe;dreams 15534;Youth is in a grand flush, like the hot days of ending summer and pleasant dreams thrall your spirit, like the smoky atmosphere that bathes the landscape of an August day.;Donald G. Mitchell;dreams 15535;Dreams are, by definition, cursed with short life spans.;Candice Bergen;dreams 15536;If you want to achieve your dreams, you must follow them, and the best way to follow them is not to think about wanting to be very rich, but to think about doing something that you really want to do.;Jackie Collins;dreams 15537;My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings.;Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley;dreams 15538;In Dreams… well, I was slightly overcompensating with that.

And yeah, I was almost shocked in the moment that it all came together so nicely.;Roger Federer;dreams 15545;Dream study impacts culture. We are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams. We hear our inner, subjective response to the outer world. That helps spiritualize our lives.;Henry Reed;dreams 15546;Freud published The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900. It introduced the notion that there existed certain predictable and identifiable processes by which dreams were formed.;Henry Reed;dreams 15547;It is easier to learn to interpret dreams if you have a reason to use them for something constructive. You apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life.;Henry Reed;dreams 15548;People are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another’s dreams. It used to be that if you told a dream in public, someone had to make a joke to relieve the tension introduced by that alternative reality.;Henry Reed;dreams 15549;People don’t think their dreams amount to much, but when I ask them to examine them for common themes, they surprise themselves at how accurate they are! They see that their dreams have value.;Henry Reed;dreams 15550;The usual comment from psychologists and psychiatrists was that it’s best not to encourage people to look at their dreams because they are liable to stir up problems for themselves.;Henry Reed;dreams 15551;Not only the priceless heritage of our fathers, of our seamen, of our Empire builders is being thrown away in a war that serves no British interests - but our alliance leader Stalin dreams of nothing but the destruction of that heritage of our fathers?;John Amery;dreams 15552;That’s what noir feels like to me. It feels like some kind of recurring dream, with very strong archetypes operating. You know, the guilty girl being pursued, falling, all kinds of stuff that we see in our dreams all the time.;Brian De Palma;dreams 15553;I always wanted to be a Californian. In my wildest dreams, I always liked California - it’s the place where oranges grows on trees! Fruit just falls off the trees.;Eric Burdon;dreams 15554;You can’t censor people’s dreams.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15555;I thin many people’s deviant behavior starts with dreams because dreams are so non-linear… as if there’s an assumption that everything has to be linear or has to be plotted.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15556;Dreams are a scientific fact.;Robyn Hitchcock;dreams 15557;It is an everlasting desire to make my dreams come true. And it’s getting to the point now where it’s like, come on I want my dreams to come true so that I can get on with the rest of my life. Sometimes I think about the rest of my life when I’m done.;Picabo Street;dreams 15558;One of my dreams in life is to do fund-raising for the youth.;Picabo Street;dreams 15559;Anderson Cooper every night dreams about getting my job permanently really.;Regis Philbin;dreams 15560;So, I think that Marilyn, what she gave the world, and in many ways Kennedy too, was that they had dreams and they didn’t allow anybody to take away their dreams.;Sally Kirkland;dreams 15561;It’s weird to say, but every time I look at my daughter and I see this little living breathing thing that came from me, that represents all of the hopes and dreams that I would want for her, I see a miracle.;Josh Gad;dreams 15562;My dreams are of water. And my nightmares.;Siouxsie Sioux;dreams 15563;You have to work hard for what you want to achieve and you have to set goals and dreams and really go for them.;Natalie du Toit;dreams 15564;I’m thinking of slowing down on modeling and branching out to other things. I want to pursue some new and old dreams and start making them happen.;Chanel Iman;dreams 15565;You cannot live to please everyone else. You have to edify, educate and fulfill your own dreams and destiny, and hope that whatever your art is that you’re putting out there, if it’s received, great, I respect you for receiving it. If it’s not received, great, I respect you for not.;Octavia Spencer;dreams 15566;I was always a closet lover of acting. My mom was very practical. She never, ever restricted our dreams, always told us we could do or be anything. Then I said, ‘Maybe I want to be an actor’. And she said, ‘Maybe not that’.;Octavia Spencer;dreams 15567;My career was full of struggles and dreams, disappointments and peaks and valleys. But there was no Twitter, no Facebook or TMZ. Young actors could make mistakes and not become the focus of tabloids.;Ricky Schroder;dreams 15568;It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one’s dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical.;Clive Barker;dreams 15569;In opposition to this detachment, he finds an image of man which contains within itself man’s dreams, man’s illness, man’s redemption from the misery of poverty - poverty which can no longer be for him a sign of the acceptance of life.;Salvatore Quasimodo;dreams 15570;Don’t let your dreams be dreams.;Jack Johnson;dreams 15571;It was taunted as reality. It was dangled as a carrot. In terms of people’s hopes and dreams, to say that that is less of a reality than the daily grind they find themselves in is maybe not correct.;Martin Mull;dreams 15572;Screenplays I didn’t really care about, journalism, travel books, getting my writer friends to write about their dreams or something. I just determined to write the books I had to write.;Kazuo Ishiguro;dreams 15573;I enjoy making solo albums because over the years it’s evolved into more of a genuine personal expression of story-telling and day dreams, and I work in a way that has more control.;Bruce Dickinson;dreams 15574;We can escape the commonplace only by manipulating it, controlling it, thrusting it into our dreams or surrendering it to the free play of our subjectivity.;Raoul Vaneigem;dreams 15575;Ever since we were little, we were so on fire for our dreams. We never let anyone blow our flames out.;Kelly Rowland;dreams 15576;I am not ridiculing verbal mechanisms, dreams, or repressions as origins of poetry all three of them and more besides may have a great deal to do with it.;Allen Tate;dreams 15577;I love to work with the younger kids who are trying to live out their dreams, if in fact that’s what they plan on doing after college to take the next step. A very select few have that opportunity so when you do have the opportunity you know, those guys take advantage of it.;Roger Clemens;dreams 15578;College baseball, I love it. I love to work with the younger kids who are trying to live out their dreams, if in fact that’s what they plan on doing after college to take the next step.;Roger Clemens;dreams 15579;My childhood dreams were focused on being part of the effort to make humanity a multiplanetary species.;Peter Diamandis;dreams 15580;We control the content of our dreams.;Thom Gunn;dreams 15581;I can have my goals, and I can have my dreams.

I was just so devastated I couldn’t get out of my seat. And I sat and watched it a second time.;Paul Reiser;dreams 15585;Maybe the body learns from dreams.
