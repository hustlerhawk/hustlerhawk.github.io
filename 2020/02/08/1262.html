But I’ve realized that it’s time for me to show my audience that you don’t have to be perfect to achieve your dreams.;Katy Perry;dreams 15257;She still talks to me now, only now she talks to me in my dreams. And I can’t wait to go to sleep tonight because we have a lot to talk about. I love you.;Jamie Foxx;dreams 15258;Do It Under the Influence Yourself! That’s what we’re shooting for!

To overcome that, I started working with my dreams, because I’m not so censored when I use dream material.;Kathy Acker;dreams 15285;I envy people with dreams and passions, but I don’t think that way. I still don’t have a ‘bliss’ to follow. For people like me - I suspect that’s most people - holding out for a ‘dream’ or a ‘passion’ is paralyzing.
