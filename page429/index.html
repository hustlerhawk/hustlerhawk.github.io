        <a href="/2020/02/08/6143" rel="permalink">Handsome’ means many things to many people. If people consider me handsome, I feel flattered - and have my parents to thank for it. Realistically, it doesn’t hurt to be good-looking, especially in this business.;Richard Chamberlain;business 7667;I feel lazy when I’m not working. I learned all my business sense from my dad. He always believed in me, and I think the last thing he said to me before he passed away was, ‘I know you’re gonna be OK. I’m not worried about you’.;Kim Kardashian;business 7668;People who have tried it, tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented but a full stomach does the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained.;Jerome K.

But to be successful, you first have to have the courage to go for it.;Bill Rancic;business 7670;Most executives, many scientists, and almost all business school graduates believe that if you analyze data, this will give you new ideas.

Paul Getty;business 7679;I think I’ve got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldn’t read and write. But he was so smart. He was just one of those people that could just make the most of anything and everything that he had to work with.;Dolly Parton;business 7680;No, there is literally nothing on the business side that I wouldn’t sacrifice in a heartbeat to have an extra couple of hours’ writing.

Johnson;business 7686;When I jumped off a roof in Cannes in a bee costume, I looked ridiculous. But this is my business I have to humiliate myself.;Jerry Seinfeld;business 7687;There are people who take rumors and embellish them in a way that can be devastating. And this pollution has to be eradicated by people in our business as best we can.;Bob Woodward;business 7688;So long as you don’t feel life’s paltry and a miserable business, the rest doesn’t matter, happiness or unhappiness.;David Herbert Lawrence;business 7689;It’s to paint directly on the canvas without any funny business, as it were, and I use almost pure turpentine to start with, adding oil as I go along until the medium becomes pure oil. I use as little oil as I can possibly help, and that’s my method.;Edward Hopper;business 7690;Come, come, leave business to idlers, and wisdom to fools: they have need of ‘em: wit be my faculty, and pleasure my occupation, and let father Time shake his glass.;William Congreve;business 7691;In this business, until you’re known as a monster you’re not a star.;Bette Davis;business 7692;Young lawyers attend the courts, not because they have business there, but because they have no business.;Washington Irving;business 7693;Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man’s starving!;O.

It’s my nature.;Taylor Swift;business 7702;I’m not asking any of you to make drastic changes to every single one of your recipes or to totally change the way you do business.

I was continuously working and doing various things.;Cat Stevens;business 7757;A satisfied customer is the best business strategy of all.;Michael LeBoeuf;business 7758;It can be hard in this business, especially when you’re very young, to figure out who you can and can’t trust.;Christina Aguilera;business 7759;It’s been a joy to be a part of other people’s journey, to be able to inspire and be a part of new singers coming up in this business.;Christina Aguilera;business 7760;Baseball just a came as simple as a ball and bat. Yet, as complex as the American spirit it symbolizes. A sport, a business and sometimes almost even a religion.;Ernie Harwell;business 7761;For me, my business is my business and my house is my house. I don’t want the public in my house.;Heidi Klum;business 7762;I’m not a kid. You don’t get in this business for anonymity. It’s not like I have posters of myself on the wall, but at the same time, I’m kind of ready for a little bit of it, but I worry for my little one, and my family - their privacy. That’s what I’m more protective of.;Hugh Jackman;business 7763;I’m a mad lover of sport. You cannot say a bad word to me about sports. So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical, and, of course, I watch it, but for me it’s pure.;Hugh Jackman;business 7764;At the end of drama school, I made a contract with myself: I’d try acting for five years. I was 26. I had already spent eight years working in restaurants and gas stations. So I had seen enough small businesses to understand that that’s what acting is: a small business.;Hugh Jackman;business 7765;I’m not into business at all.;Freddie Mercury;business 7766;Well, there’s different shades of Hollywood, sure. I mean, I’m working in this business but I’m not Hollywood.;Shia LaBeouf;business 7767;The comic book world is a tough business.;Shia LaBeouf;business 7768;Obamacare has got everyone on edge. I mean, small business - men and women or big business are sitting out there saying we have no idea what this is going to cost, but we know it’s going to cost us and cost us a lot.;Rick Perry;business 7769;When I’ve gone back to work, it’s always with that sense of inevitability. That may be a complete delusion, but it’s the one that I need to get out of bed and go about my business. That sense that I can’t avoid this thing. I better just get on with it.;Daniel Day-Lewis;business 7770;After a while of getting jerked around, you realize what the business is really made up of.;Tori Amos;business 7771;People assume that all artists make for terrible business people, but I’m in complete charge of my own career.;Tori Amos;business 7772;There’s a side to this industry that nurtures divas who can’t write. It’s a big business.;Tori Amos;business 7773;There is no substitute for accurate knowledge. Know yourself, know your business, know your men.;Lee Iacocca;business 7774;A guy named Charlie Beacham was my first mentor at Ford.

I have never met a job creator who told me that they were waiting for the next tax increase before they started growing their business. I’ve never met a single job creator who’s ever said to me I can’t wait until government raises taxes again so I can go out and create a job.;Marco Rubio;business 7780;You know who a complicated tax code kills? The guy or gal trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom of their home. So we’ve got to simplify our tax code.;Marco Rubio;business 7781;Americans chose a free enterprise system designed to provide a quality of opportunity, not compel a quality of results. And that is why this is only place in the world where you can open up a business in the spare bedroom of your home.;Marco Rubio;business 7782;Barack Obama doesn’t believe in free enterprise. He’s never going to admit it. For instance, he’s never going to come straight out and say, ‘If you own a business you didn’t build it.’ Alright, maybe he will.;Marco Rubio;business 7783;There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can’t look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?;Andrea Jung;business 7784;Would you want to do business with a person who was 99% honest?;Sydney Madwed;business 7785;I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend.;Elvis Presley;business 7786;The business side of film has goofed up so many things, but even that’s changing.

But artists should have control of their work especially if, as I always say, you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea.;David Lynch;business 7787;Some of the greatest actors have turned superheroes into a serious business: Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in ‘Batman’ Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, the first venerable knights of the X-Men, who have now passed the baton to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy.;Tom Hiddleston;business 7788;Run a home like you would a small business and treat it with the same seriousness.;Anthea Turner;business 7789;I know I did the right thing by taking time off to raise my son. But it also came at a price. I turned down many opportunities over the years because I didn’t want to leave him for long periods of time. And in Hollywood, as in any business, the calls stop coming when you don’t answer.;Arsenio Hall;business 7790;I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It’s done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer.;Richard Branson;business 7791;The desire to hit a big home run is dominating the music business.;Billy Corgan;business 7792;I did 13-something years of talking to wrestlers and promoters about why they did certain things and why they booked matches a certain way and what they were thinking and whether they were satisfied with the draw.

It’s too late for us.;Jerry Garcia;business 7802;And what most people don’t understand is the bulk of business in this country is small business.;Alphonso Jackson;business 7803;Law is not a profession at all, but rather a business service station and repair shop.;Adlai E. Stevenson;business 7804;We mean by ‘politics’ the people’s business - the most important business there is.;Adlai E. Stevenson;business 7805;I am a sensitive writer, actor and director. Talking business disgusts me. If you want to talk business, call my disgusting personal manager.;Sylvester Stallone;business 7806;My compulsion to always be working has become less strong and my current business is purely down to this enormous alimony. If I wasn’t doing this I’d be making documentaries about wildlife and other subjects that interest me.;John Cleese;business 7807;After hurting myself like that, I could not go back immediately to racing. I was in no condition, mentally or physically. That helped me to strengthen myself to go through the hard times that were ahead with my business, and to be successful.;Nelson Piquet;business 7808;The chances of a bank going out of business are extremely slim, but it’s always a good idea to spread around major sums so every penny is backed by insurance.;Suze Orman;business 7809;Nobody has wrestled everybody in the business like I have, especially not Bret Hart.;Ric Flair;business 7810;The Internet is the Viagra of big business.;Jack Welch;business 7811;I do seem to like to combine the dramatic emotional warmth of strings with the grooves and body business of drums and bass.;David Byrne;business 7812;Artists are notoriously snooty and suspicious of anything coming from the business community.;David Byrne;business 7813;Like sex in Victorian England, the reality of Big Business today is our big dirty secret.;Ralph Nader;business 7814;Really, I have to laugh because there was a whole set of stories that made me sound like the Dragon Lady, you know, ‘tough this and tough that.’ Then there is this business about ‘gooey.’ The bottom line is I am a pragmatic idealist.;Madeleine Albright;business 7815;You do have to do business with and to try to influence people you don’t agree with, or find disagreeable, so it’s important to stress that balance.;William Hague;business 7816;The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.;Pierre Trudeau;business 7817;Many people would no more think of entering journalism than the sewage business - which at least does us all some good.;Stephen Fry;business 7818;Business practices and how we treat the planet are also in desperate need of re-humanization.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7819;What today’s business reality makes clear is that brands cannot survive in a society that is failing economically, socially, ethically, and morally.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7820;As a speaker, business leader or marketer of any type, the onus is now on each of us to become equally capable of communicating very personally with a seemingly endless number of people connected by social technologies.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7821;In the coming years, if not sooner, social media will become a powerful tool that consumers will aggressively use to influence business attitudes and force companies into greater social responsibility - and, I suggest, move us towards a more sustainable practice of capitalism.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7822;Perhaps the most effective way to describe the approach a brand must take is to think of themselves as social cartographers. By that I mean that brands must simultaneously inspire, engage and maintain a series of conversations taking place within certain cultural landscape specific to their business goal.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7823;The social business marketplace is effectively forcing brands to engage with consumers on the basis of something that is meaningful to them. More often than not, this takes the form of some core value that finds expression in a non-profit cause.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7824;Integrate purpose into your for-profit business model through a long term commitment to a cause that is aligned with your core values and those of your community.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7825;In today’s social business marketplace Facebook is one of the best places for nonprofits to be discovered and connect with a larger audience on the basis of shared values. So to get started, a non-profit should launch a Facebook page and invite your existing real world community to connect your cause and their networks.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7826;In the social business marketplace, brands that hope to build loyal and growing communities do so most effectively when they demonstrate their core values and allow a community to build and engage around it.;Simon Mainwaring;business 7827;Billions are wasted on ineffective philanthropy. Philanthropy is decades behind business in applying rigorous thinking to the use of money.;Michael Porter;business 7828;God will forgive me that’s his business.;Heinrich Heine;business 7829;The world can forgive practically anything except people who mind their own business.;Margaret Mitchell;business 7830;As a restaurateur, my job is to basically control the chaos and the drama. There’s always going to be chaos in the restaurant business.;Rocco DiSpirito;business 7831;If I could set a world record, it would be that I have 150 business partners, all with thriving businesses of their own that started with nothing and I made the difference to make them all billionaires.;Barbara Corcoran;business 7832;Where are the jobs going to come from?Small business, manufacturing and clean energy. Where’s the money to finance them? The banks and the corporations in America today have lots of money that they can invest right now.;William J. Clinton;business 7833;We need to stop apologizing for celebrating life. We need to stop apologizing for wanting to protect an individual’s right to build a business.;Rick Perry;business 7834;Somebody has to tell the E.P.A. that we don’t need you monkeying around and fiddling around and getting in our business with every kind of regulation you can dream up. You’re doing nothing more than killing jobs. It’s a cemetery for jobs at the E.P.A.;Rick Perry;business 7835;We must have ideals and try to live up to them, even if we never quite succeed. Life would be a sorry business without them. With them it’s grand and great.;Lucy Maud Montgomery;business 7836;There are people in the public sector with a range of experiences that have no equivalent in business, but are essential to governing, like keeping a kid in school or helping someone get and hold a job. The value of those skills can’t easily be measured against a bottom line.;Dee Dee Myers;business 7837;It’s wonderful to have the most important thing in the world there first thing in the morning.

For me it is keeping my priorities in order: It’s my faith and my family, and then the business.;Kathy Ireland;business 7839;The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;business 7840;In an age of incompetence, I’ve been able to last in this crazy business. I actually know how to play my ax and write a song. That’s my job.;Billy Joel;business 7841;In this business, my business, I get to meet all kinds of incredible people, fascinating people, glamorous people and sexy people and highly intellectual people. And you meet them and you go ‘interesting, interesting, interesting’. They’re interesting, but not very many people stop you in your tracks.;Madonna Ciccone;business 7842;I’m very free-spirited and crazy. I love to have fun, and I like doing stupid things. At the same time, I’m like a 35-year-old. I have a house. I have a car. I have a steady job. I have a business, and I have to make serious decisions.;Avril Lavigne;business 7843;And I want to do it the right way, like everybody else, not just a famous figurehead that gets a job because he is a famous basketball player. I want to really learn the business.;Shaquille O’Neal;business 7844;In business, you’re the Chief Salesman. Create a sense of demand, rather than waiting to have demand.;Barbara Corcoran;business 7845;The hardest thing about being in this business is just being able to be yourself. People act like t
