        <a href="/2020/02/08/21793" rel="permalink">Married with Children’ was racy. It was sexist. It was a lot of things, but mostly it was funny.;Katey Sagal;funny 26270;My mother was a terrific force in my life. Wartime-generation woman, hadn’t gone to university but should have done. Was very funny, very verbal, very clever, very witty.;Ian Hislop;funny 26271;I was doing sketches that were funny but socially irresponsible. I felt I was deliberately being encouraged and I was overwhelmed.;Dave Chappelle;funny 26272;It’s funny recently I’ve started to notice people’s impersonations of me, and it’s basically like a hyperactive child.;Dave Grohl;funny 26273;It’s funny I actually made poorer decisions when I sobered up then when I was screwed up.;Corey Feldman;funny 26274;It’s funny, having the same name as someone. Me, Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the amount of times I’ve been called Emma Watson or Emma Stone is so funny. It’s just ‘cause we’re all named Emma. None of us look alike.;Emma Roberts;funny 26275;I don’t really have a type of guy I like. It’s just like nice guys, cute boys I mean, ones that are funny.;Emma Roberts;funny 26276;But I think Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang really got that thing where, if a movie reads really funny and then has some dramatic or violent or sinister stuff in it, you can’t forget that primarily it has to be even funnier than you read it or that other stuff doesn’t work.;Robert Downey, Jr.;funny 26277;I wish I could be as thin as Jessica Simpson. I think she looks gorgeous! I have had Jessica on my show several times, and I can tell you that girl is genuine and funny with a great self-deprecating sense of humor.;Rachael Ray;funny 26278;And at the time, it is funny how you can look at something and say, for example with my shoulder injury, when it first happened I said this is the worst thing that could happen to me. Why me, why now? Now I look back and say it was probably the best thing that happened to me.;Drew Brees;funny 26279;I think we’re the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It’s not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;funny 26280;We’ve got a bunch of new writers now who tell me they grew up watching The Simpsons. It’s bizarre, and they’re writing some very funny stuff.;Matt Groening;funny 26281;Sometimes people get mad at The Simpsons’ subversive story telling, but there’s another message in there, which is a celebration of making wild, funny stories.;Matt Groening;funny 26282;I can always get better. A lot of my ex-girlfriends don’t think I’m funny.;Dane Cook;funny 26283;I didn’t plan to be the rude middle-class comedian. You write a certain type of joke that you find funny, and mine happen to be often rude. Yes, it’s juvenile, but that’s me.;Jimmy Carr;funny 26284;Only bad golfers are lucky. They’re the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.;Lee Trevino;funny 26285;Music is more difficult - try naming a political band. The Dead Kennedys. The Dead Kennedys are political, but they are more funny than they are political.;Thom Yorke;funny 26286;We sit in a room for months trying to think of funny things.;David Walliams;funny 26287;I love a smart, well-written show, and ‘30 Rock,’ well, you can’t get any better than that. Tina Fey poos funny. There’s nothing that she does that isn’t funny. That show is an example of how brilliant she is. It’s so smart. They’ve done some brilliant commentary about the ‘Housewives’ with ‘Queen of Jordan,’ their show-within-the-show.;Andy Cohen;funny 26288;I am accusing him of stealing my best material, he was a very funny man.;Frank Carson;funny 26289;It’s unbearable when someone changes around you. Just imagine that your life partner changes, then it is difficult to cope with. Or your mother. Or your father. They were strong and now they’re like a baby - it’s not so funny.;Michael Haneke;funny 26290;’Funny Games’ was conceived as a provocation. My other films are different. If people feel my other films are, or respond to them as provocation, then that’s quite different. ‘Funny Games’ is the only one of mine where my intention was to provoke the audience.;Michael Haneke;funny 26291;When I first envisioned ‘Funny Games’ in the mid-1990s, it was my intention to have an American audience watch the movie. It is a reaction to a certain American cinema, its violence, its naivety, the way American cinema toys with human beings. In many American films, violence is made consumable.;Michael Haneke;funny 26292;I have an inability to enjoy things, but that’s why we’re in comedy. If we were happy, we wouldn’t be funny, I guess.;Paul Feig;funny 26293;For years, it’s driven me crazy that women don’t have better roles, especially in comedies. I know so many funny women but I always felt… misogynist streak is too strong a term - but a dismissiveness.;Paul Feig;funny 26294;I love funny people, and when I’m with funny people, or people who are amusing in their weirdness, I love it. Because that to me is funny, as opposed to someone who stops and says, ‘Hey let me tell you a joke.
