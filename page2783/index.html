        <a href="/2020/02/08/15987" rel="permalink">Let God be true but every man a liar’ is the language of true faith.;Aiden Wilson Tozer;faith 19450;In Barack Obama, Democrats have put forth a man of strong religious faith who is comfortable connecting his spiritual life to his public role as a policymaker.;Mike McCurry;faith 19451;Flatter not thyself in thy faith in God if thou hast not charity for thy neighbor.;Francis Quarles;faith 19452;But I don’t necessarily define my faith by going to church every Sunday.;Miley Cyrus;faith 19453;What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.;Peter Singer;faith 19454;Machiavelli’s teaching would hardly have stood the test of Parliamentary government, for public discussion demands at least the profession of good faith.;Lord Acton;faith 19455;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew. Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;faith 19456;Skepticism has never founded empires, established principals, or changed the world’s heart. The great doers in history have always been people of faith.;Edwin Hubbel Chapin;faith 19457;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith. It’s perfectly possible to go to church every Sunday and not ask any questions, just because you like it as a way of life. They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19458;The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19459;The great act of faith is when a man decides he is not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;faith 19460;Not truth, but faith, it is that keeps the world alive.;Edna St. Vincent Millay;faith 19461;A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.;Tony Benn;faith 19462;The essential element in personal magnetism is a consuming sincerity - an overwhelming faith in the importance of the work one has to do.;Bruce Barton;faith 19463;By gold all good faith has been banished by gold our rights are abused the law itself is influenced by gold, and soon there will be an end of every modest restraint.;Sextus Propertius;faith 19464;I don’t have faith in young people any more. I don’t waste time trying to communicate with them.;Vivienne Westwood;faith 19465;Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.;Lester B. Pearson;faith 19466;Act strenuously, would appear to be our faith, and right thinking will take care of itself.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19467;The democratic idealist is prone to make light of the whole question of standards and leadership because of his unbounded faith in the plain people.;Irving Babbitt;faith 19468;The saddest thing that befalls a soul is when it loses faith in God and woman.;Alexander Smith;faith 19469;With gridlock the norm, Congress’s approval rating is below 10 percent and the public has lost faith in its national leadership.;Ron Fournier;faith 19470;You can almost see voters nodding their heads at home: The public’s faith in politicians and political institutions has been on a steep and dangerous decline for decades, because elected leaders fail to deliver.;Ron Fournier;faith 19471;I don’t need faith.;Maurice Sendak;faith 19472;To try to fashion something from suffering, to relish our triumphs, and to endure defeats without resentment: all that is compatible with the faith of a heretic.;Walter Kaufmann;faith 19473;Red Letter Christians believe in the doctrines of the Apostle’s Creed, are convinced that the Scriptures have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, and make having a personal transforming relationship with the resurrected Christ the touchtone of their faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19474;It’s a new day for the Democrats when it comes to matters of faith, and the younger Evangelicals are aware of this and many of them are moving into the Democratic camp.;Tony Campolo;faith 19475;Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.;Tony Campolo;faith 19476;But I recognize no infallible authority, even in special questions consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such an individual, I have no absolute faith in any person.;Mikhail Bakunin;faith 19477;From faith, hope, and love, the virtues of religion referring to God, there arises a double act which bears on the spiritual communion exercised between God and us the hearing of the word and prayer.;William Ames;faith 19478;Religious faith depends on a host of social, psychological and emotional factors that have little or nothing to do with probabilities, evidence and logic.;Michael Shermer;faith 19479;He who is not impressed by sound advice, lacks faith.;Abu Bakr;faith 19480;That someone like Obama could be elected president of the United States - with its unrivaled power and prestige - has begun to restore the country’s and the world’s faith in America as the land of opportunity.;Dee Dee Myers;faith 19481;Faith is not a notion, but a real strong essential hunger, an attracting or magnetic desire of Christ, which as it proceeds from a seed of the divine nature in us, so it attracts and unites with its like.;William Law;faith 19482;I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don’t know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.;Ryan Gosling;faith 19483;Resist your fear fear will never lead to you a positive end. Go for your faith and what you believe.;T. D. Jakes;faith 19484;Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.;J. C. Watts;faith 19485;I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I’m growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.;J. C. Watts;faith 19486;If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.;E. W. Howe;faith 19487;One of the embarrassing problems for the early nineteenth-century champions of the Christian faith was that not one of the first six Presidents of the United States was an orthodox Christian.;Mortimer Adler;faith 19488;Evolution and creationism both require faith. It’s just a matter of where you choose to place that faith.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19489;Over the years my mother’s steadfast faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I had to perform extremely difficult surgical procedures or when I found myself faced with my own medical scare.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19490;The mind controls so much of the body. We are much more than flesh and blood we are complex systems. Patients do better when they have faith that they’re going to do better. That’s why I always tell my patients and their families not to neglect their prayers. There’s nobody I don’t say that to.;Benjamin Carson;faith 19491;My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.;Vin Diesel;faith 19492;Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.;Heinrich Heine;faith 19493;Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.;Robert Collier;faith 19494;The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it’s a faith issue, it’s a religious issue.;Jim Wallis;faith 19495;Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;faith 19496;It’s possible that the 2012 general-election race will be the least overtly religious one since 1972, the last campaign before Roe v. Wade and the rise of Jimmy Carter brought evangelicalism into the political mainstream. That’s because faith remains a complicated issue for Obama, who is still wrongly thought to be a Muslim in some quarters.;Jon Meacham;faith 19497;While we remain a nation decisively shaped by religious faith, our politics and our culture are, in the main, less influenced by movements and arguments of an explicitly Christian character than they were even five years ago. I think this is a good thing - good for our political culture.;Jon Meacham;faith 19498;I am an Episcopalian who takes the faith of my fathers seriously, and I would, I think, be disheartened if my own young children were to turn away from the church when they grow up. I am also a critic of Christianity, if by critic one means an observer who brings historical and literary judgment to bear on the texts and traditions of the church.;Jon Meacham;faith 19499;As crucial as religion has been and is to the life of the nation, America’s unifying force has never been a specific faith, but a commitment to freedom - not least freedom of conscience.;Jon Meacham;faith 19500;Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.;Jon Meacham;faith 19501;My faith foundation works to bring about a greater respect and understanding between different faiths. We basically work with six popular religions in the world which are the three Abrahamic religions, Hinduism and Buddhism and Sikhism.;Tony Blair;faith 19502;You know, this idea of going around the world imposing democracy by growing a middle-class, a trading merchant class that is independent of your faith, is a good notion, but we’re all partially different - it’s no good imposing systems on people that it doesn’t suit.;Damian Lewis;faith 19503;Writers now are putting total faith in designers at Apple and Amazon. It’s almost like a race-car driver having no input into how cars are designed.;Jonathan Safran Foer;faith 19504;It’s OK to be outspoken about your faith.;Tim Tebow;faith 19505;Stupidity, outrage, vanity, cruelty, iniquity, bad faith, falsehood - we fail to see the whole array when it is facing in the same direction as we.;Jean Rostand;faith 19506;Intelligence must follow faith, never precede it, and never destroy it.;Thomas a Kempis;faith 19507;Used to be, conservatives revered the Average American, that Norman Rockwell oil painting of diner food, humble faith, honest toil, and Capraesque virtue.;James Wolcott;faith 19508;After a decade this glum, we deserved a shot of ‘Glee,’ a show that restored our faith in the power of song, the beauty of dance, and the magic of ‘spirit fingers’ to chase our cares and woes into somebody else’s backyard.;James Wolcott;faith 19509;I have written too much history to have faith in it and if anyone thinks I’m wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.;Henry Adams;faith 19510;No man likes to have his intelligence or good faith questioned, especially if he has doubts about it himself.;Henry Adams;faith 19511;Democrats are people who raise your taxes and spend your money on weird stuff. They steal your guns, and they spit on your faith.;Grover Norquist;faith 19512;Faith in God’s revelation has nothing to do with an ideology which glorifies the status quo.;Karl Barth;faith 19513;For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.;Giacomo Casanova;faith 19514;You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don’t you use them in the search for love?;Lech Walesa;faith 19515;I’m a scientist, not a theologian. I don’t know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.;James Lovelock;faith 19516;Laughter kills fear, and without fear there can be no faith. For without fear of the devil there is no need for God.;Sean Connery;faith 19517;There are so many people that don’t believe in themselves and don’t have faith.;Lenny Kravitz;faith 19518;All an actor has is their blind faith that they are who they say they are today, in any scene.;Meryl Streep;faith 19519;From those to whom much is given, much is expected. I have been given much - the love of my family, the faith and trust of the people of New York, and the chance to lead this state. I am deeply sorry that I did not live up to what was expected of me.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19520;As someone with a deep faith in competition and the market, I also know that markets only work with tough enforcement of the rules that guarantee competition and fair play - and that the pressure to break those rules only gets stronger as the amount of money involved gets larger.;Eliot Spitzer;faith 19521;Everything I am I owe to my faith and secondly to parents who were old school.;J. C. Watts;faith 19522;It’s a war of attrition. If you have patience and a modicum of faith in yourself your chances are not too bad.;Julie Bowen;faith 19523;I had lost faith in biography.;A. N. Wilson;faith 19524;The Pledge of Allegiance reflects the truth that faith in God has played a significant role in America since the days of the founding of our country.;Randy Neugebauer;faith 19525;If you desire faith, then you have faith enough.;Elizabeth Barrett Browning;faith 19526;I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along.;Bruce Springsteen;faith 19527;For both faith and want of faith have destroyed men alike.;Hesiod;faith 19528;I have faith in the United States and our ability to make good decisions based on the facts.;Al Gore;faith 19529;If you went to your closet today, would you pull out the same outfit you wore 10 or 15 years ago? You wear feelings and faith differently as well.;Amy Grant;faith 19530;Jews survived all the defeats, expulsions, persecutions and pogroms, the centuries in which they were regarded as a pariah people, even the Holocaust itself, because they never gave up the faith that one day they would be free to live as Jews without fear.;Jonathan Sacks;faith 19531;The royals - all of them, especially Prince Philip and Prince Charles - have done outstanding work with the faith communities.;Jonathan Sacks;faith 19532;The faith religious believers have in God is small compared to the faith people put in politicians, knowing how many times they have been disappointed in the past but still insisting that this time it will be different.;Jonathan Sacks;faith 19533;In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century, we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude, helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.;Jonathan Sacks;faith 19534;An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments.
