        <a href="/2020/02/08/32545" rel="permalink">Avatar’ is the greatest, most comprehensive collection of movie cliches ever assembled, but it’s put together in a brand new way with a new technology, and tremendous imagination, making it a true epic and a kind of a milestone.;Joe Dante;imagination 37915;Painting and sculpture are very archaic forms. It’s the only thing left in our industrial society where an individual alone can make something with not just his own hands, but brains, imagination, heart maybe.;Philip Guston;imagination 37916;I feel very warm towards Mum and Dad for giving us the independence they did. My childhood, and the fact we didn’t have a TV, gave me a boundless imagination.;Dido Armstrong;imagination 37917;That neither our thoughts, nor passions, nor ideas formed by the imagination, exist without the mind, is what every body will allow.;George Berkeley;imagination 37918;Imagination is the only key to the future. Without it none exists - with it all things are possible.;Ida Tarbell;imagination 37919;Usually I say I have no imagination.;Jose Padilha;imagination 37920;Imagination, the traitor of the mind, has taken my solitude and slain it.;Robinson Jeffers;imagination 37921;As a bookish child in Calcutta, I used to thrill to the adventures of bad girls whose pursuit of happiness swept them outside the bounds of social decency. Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina lived large in my imagination. The naughty girls of Hollywood films flirted and knew how to drive.;Bharati Mukherjee;imagination 37922;I loved the world of imagination.;R. A. Salvatore;imagination 37923;People who think my books are autobiographical, which they’re not, credit me with having a much better memory than I do. I do, however, have a powerful imagination.;Curtis Sittenfeld;imagination 37924;I had been a reporter for 15 years when I set out to write my first novel. I knew how to research an article or profile a subject - skills that I assumed would be useless when it came to fiction. It was from my imagination that the characters in my story would emerge.;Amy Waldman;imagination 37925;Imagination, it turns out, is a great deal like reporting in your own head. Here is a paradox of fiction-writing. You are crafting something from nothing, which means, in one sense, that none of it is true. Yet in the writing, and perhaps in the reading, some of a character’s actions or lines are truer than others.;Amy Waldman;imagination 37926;Although Bill Finger literally typed the scripts in the early days, he wrote the scripts from ideas that we mutually collaborated on. Many of the unique concepts and story twists also came from my own fertile imagination.;Bob Kane;imagination 37927;When one paints an ideal, one does not need to limit one’s imagination.;Ellen Key;imagination 37928;Nature uses human imagination to lift her work of creation to even higher levels.;Luigi Pirandello;imagination 37929;When you are young your imagination is so clear.;Nina Blackwood;imagination 37930;I mean, it’s fine when you’re a kid and someone runs into the playground and goes, ‘I’ve got this great game of pretend,’ and you play… As an actor, getting to play, getting to use your imagination and be childish - it is weird but it’s wonderful.;Max Irons;imagination 37931;An art aims, above all, at producing something beautiful which affects not our feelings but the organ of pure contemplation, our imagination.;Eduard Hanslick;imagination 37932;People can’t just listen to the music and have their own imagination and take them where they wanna go.;Ann Wilson;imagination 37933;I love costumes. I love getting dressed up because it really helps my imagination make the leap to believe that I am who I say I am.;Alessandro Nivola;imagination 37934;It’s just a way of trying to get to a third thing that’s not particular to any quote-unquote genre. It’s been great for me it’s really opened me up and gotten me to use that part of my imagination. It’s very scary in a lot of ways, and just as exciting.;Charlie Hunter;imagination 37935;I guess what I’ve learned is that there are no boundaries when it comes to imagination. It’s limitless.;Cliff Martinez;imagination 37936;She has no imagination and that means no compassion.;Michael Foot;imagination 37937;To them though, not to us, we were just a catalyst for their imagination.;Donald Sutherland;imagination 37938;To put up a show is to face life’s injustices with one of the few weapons available to a desperate and brave people, their imagination.;Luigi Barzini;imagination 37939;I have learned the art of filling in your lines with your visuals and your movies and your imagination.;Daphne Zuniga;imagination 37940;I definitely gravitate towards quality genre projects and genre of any kind whether it’s science fiction, horror or really anything. I’m just drawn to quality. I don’t think ‘Darkness Falls’ is horror there isn’t any gore by any stretch of the imagination.;Emma Caulfield;imagination 37941;It’s a wonderful thing working with young actors. I know a lot of people don’t like working with children. I actually adore it, because you watch their imagination open up and you watch them start to learn this job that I’ve been doing for so long. They come with such a lack of cynicism.;Michelle Forbes;imagination 37942;We didn’t have television until I was about eight years old, so it was either the movies or radio. A lot of radio drama. That was our television, you know. We had to use our imagination. So it was really those two things, and the comics, that I immersed myself in as a child.;Jessica Hagedorn;imagination 37943;Grandchildren have taught me how important the future is. I try to look through their eyes and envision what’s in their imagination. What’s the world going to look like when they’re my age? That really does take a huge imagination.;Richard Lugar;imagination 37944;Catastrophes are often stimulated by the failure to feel the emergence of a domain, and so what cannot be felt in the imagination is experienced as embodied sensation in the catastrophe.;William Irwin Thompson;imagination 37945;George has only got to ring me. His imagination is so wonderful, I’d do any character he might create.;Peter Mayhew;imagination 37946;I don’t know if Jim was a major part of that or not. He is one of a small group of real storytellers. He has enormous imagination and ability to write. I’m glad he’s coming back. It’s going to be good for the show.;Matthew Ashford;imagination 37947;No film has captivated my imagination more than ‘King Kong.’ I’m making movies today because I saw this film when I was 9 years old.;Peter Jackson;imagination 37948;Enthusiasm is that temper of the mind in which the imagination has got the better of the judgment.;William Warburton;imagination 37949;If there is a book that the script came from you have to read it, you have to see what you can get out of it: mood, back story and things that may not even be in the film. They kick off your imagination and broaden the character, I think.;Miranda Otto;imagination 37950;Regardless of who originally made it popular, any hit song becomes a challenge to the ingenuity and imagination of other musicians and performers.;Les Baxter;imagination 37951;Most people have no imagination. If they could imagine the sufferings of others, they would not make them suffer so. What separated a German mother from a French mother?;Ernst Toller;imagination 37952;I had this wild imagination. I was never me. All my childhood photos, I’m in fancy dress, playing a Russian refuge or Marvelous Mad Madam Mim.;Juno Temple;imagination 37953;I was brought up in a very open, rural countryside in the middle of nowhere. There were no cell phones. If your lights went out, you were lit by candlelight for a good four days before they can get to you. And so, my imagination was crazy.;Juno Temple;imagination 37954;I’m only interested in fiction that in some way or other voices the very imagination which is conceiving it.;John C.

Farmer, Jr.;imagination 37958;As an actor I think sometimes producers need a little bit of encouragement to see you in a particular role, they may not have as much imagination as you would expect.;Steve Kanaly;imagination 37959;Death? Why this fuss about death? Use your imagination, try to visualize a world without death! Death is the essential condition of life, not an evil.;Charlotte Perkins Gilman;imagination 37960;Innovation is this amazing intersection between someone’s imagination and the reality in which they live. The problem is, many companies don’t have great imagination, but their view of reality tells them that it’s impossible to do what they imagine.;Ron Johnson;imagination 37961;It is the work of fancy to enlarge, but of judgment to shorten and contract and therefore this must be as far above the other as judgment is a greater and nobler faculty than fancy or imagination.;Robert South;imagination 37962;In The Touch, the love scenes are the same as they were in The Thorn Birds or anything else I’ve ever written. I find a way of saying that either it was heaven or hell but in a way that still leaves room for the reader to use their own imagination.;Colleen McCullough;imagination 37963;If they want to talk about aliens and anything like that… that’s part of the gift God gave us. That’s what makes life exciting. We’re pretty stuck, you know. What gives flight to our life is our imagination.;Michael Moriarty;imagination 37964;Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.;Nadine Gordimer;imagination 37965;There’s not one major greatest influence on my career. It would be film and great artists and great imagineers - Jim Henson, Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, people who understand the joy of the imagination.;Zac Posen;imagination 37966;My mother was making $135 a week, but she had resilience and imagination. She might take frozen vegetables, cook them with garlic, onion and Spam, and it would taste like a four-star dinner.;Andre Dubus III;imagination 37967;There’s no environment. Use your imagination. There’s no fourth wall, whether it’s the first time you’ve told this story about her life, or the sixth time.;Jill Clayburgh;imagination 37968;I guess something that I’ve noticed from American acts who had success in touring is more of an explanation as to their music.

It’s dance theatre and it requires you to use your imagination - it’s not straight forward.;Matthew Bourne;imagination 37972;Every day the eye is subject to a thousand tiny shocks as a thousand industries compete for the eye-kick, the visual hook that will lock the consumer into product for that crucial second where the tiny - or not so tiny - leap of the imagination is made.;Graham Joyce;imagination 37973;But the greatest thing about music is putting it out there for people to figure out.

But I wouldn’t really want to work with those people, you know?;Michael C. Hall;imagination 37976;Fantasies are more than substitutes for unpleasant reality they are also dress rehearsals, plans. All acts performed in the world begin in the imagination.;Barbara Grizzuti Harrison;imagination 37977;I’m not claiming that football is the nation’s salvation in this area, but it’s one of them, one little thing that apparently has captured the imagination of a large sector of our society. But when football can’t be a relatively pure outlet, a fun thing, then it hurts itself.;Pete Rozelle;imagination 37978;A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing.;Charles M. Schwab;imagination 37979;The fashions of the ages vary in this direction and that, but they vary for the most part from a central road which was struck out by the imagination of Greece.;Gilbert Murray;imagination 37980;But there is so much more to do for the city we love… a Dallas with roads as strong as our businesses, parks as beautiful as our children, a downtown as tall as our imagination.;Laura Miller;imagination 37981;Because of my faith and my imagination, I was able to enjoy my childhood, even though it was tough.;Donna Brazile;imagination 37982;The imagination is the golden pathway to everywhere.;Terence McKenna;imagination 37983;Doing ‘White Collar,’ quite often my character goes undercover, so therein lies the compounding of the imagination.
