Any artist’s big fear is being ignored, so if you get debate, that’s great.;Damien Hirst;fear 22246;A book is the only place in which you can examine a fragile thought without breaking it, or explore an explosive idea without fear it will go off in your face. It is one of the few havens remaining where a man’s mind can get both provocation and privacy.;Edward P. Morgan;fear 22247;I spoke without fear of contradiction. I simply did not suffer self-doubt.;Elia Kazan;fear 22248;I’ve probably earned the right to screw up a few times. I don’t want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.;Emma Watson;fear 22249;There’s an honesty in our family - my kids and I are able to talk about things without me putting the fear of God into them.;Billie Joe Armstrong;fear 22250;Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.;Samuel Ullman;fear 22251;When I have a camera in my hand, I know no fear.;Alfred Eisenstaedt;fear 22252;There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in life as fear.;Jawaharlal Nehru;fear 22253;Fear is the mother of foresight.;Thomas Hardy;fear 22254;The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers. It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.;Adam Smith;fear 22255;Greed, like the love of comfort, is a kind of fear.;Cyril Connolly;fear 22256;He who doesn’t fear death dies only once.;Giovanni Falcone;fear 22257;The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat - to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace.;Thomas Frank;fear 22258;One of the scary things is that, when you’re a kid, you look at your dad as the man who has no fear. When you’re an adult, you realize your father had fear, and that you have it, too.;David Duchovny;fear 22259;The fear factor actually brings the genuineness.;Ang Lee;fear 22260;In politics, what begins in fear usually ends in failure.;Samuel Taylor Coleridge;fear 22261;I would sum up my fear about the future in one word: boring. And that’s my one fear: that everything has happened nothing exciting or new or interesting is ever going to happen again… the future is just going to be a vast, conforming suburb of the soul.;J. G. Ballard;fear 22262;I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free.;LL Cool J;fear 22263;A star on a movie set is like a time bomb. That bomb has got to be defused so people can approach it without fear.;Jack Nicholson;fear 22264;My whole life I’ve had the fear that I was going to be abandoned.;Halle Berry;fear 22265;I think one of the terrible things today is that people have this deathly fear of food: fear of eggs, say, or fear of butter. Most doctors feel that you can have a little bit of everything.;Julia Child;fear 22266;I won’t allow myself to have tremendous fear.;Calvin Klein;fear 22267;Any fear of aging, I think, is simply vanity.;Leighton Meester;fear 22268;Mysticism and exaggeration go together. A mystic must not fear ridicule if he is to push all the way to the limits of humility or the limits of delight.;Milan Kundera;fear 22269;I fear God and next to God I mostly fear them that fear him not.;Saadi;fear 22270;Some people need to stay at the top. They are afraid to re-start from zero because they fear the critics.;Eric Cantona;fear 22271;There is no greater hell than to be a prisoner of fear.;Ben Jonson;fear 22272;As long as enough people can be frightened, then all people can be ruled. That is how it works in a democratic system and mass fear becomes the ticket to destroy rights across the board.;James Bovard;fear 22273;My biggest fear in life is to be forgotten.;Evita Peron;fear 22274;We all have that burning question about what happens if we lose somebody we love, especially if we lose them tragically. We wonder what fear was going on, we wonder if we could have reached out and touched them, held their hand, looked in their eyes, been there.;Kevin Costner;fear 22275;To withdraw is not to run away, and to stay is no wise action, when there’s more reason to fear than to hope.;Miguel de Cervantes;fear 22276;I fear no man, no beast or evil, brother.;Hulk Hogan;fear 22277;Courage is a special kind of knowledge: the knowledge of how to fear what ought to be feared and how not to fear what ought not to be feared.;David Ben-Gurion;fear 22278;A merchant who approaches business with the idea of serving the public well has nothing to fear from the competition.;James Cash Penney;fear 22279;You can ask me pretty much anything. There’ll be things I’ll go, ‘That feels a little too personal.’ But most things I don’t have a fear of being asked about.;Nicole Kidman;fear 22280;You cannot avoid war in life, you cannot avoid the fear of terrorism, you cannot avoid those things now, they are a part of everyday demeanor.;John Mayer;fear 22281;Fame does lead to money, which I don’t have a close relationship with. I’m the kind of guy who never sees the money - it all goes somewhere else. I don’t understand it, I don’t like to deal with it.

Fear leads them to ask, if we cannot trust the Bible, what can we trust?;Garrett Hardin;fear 22289;I woke up full of hate and fear the day before the most recent peace march in San Francisco. This was disappointing: I’d hoped to wake up feeling somewhere between Virginia Woolf and Wavy Gravy.;Anne Lamott;fear 22290;My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another.

Each prepared me for the next leaf on which I would land, and in this way I moved across the swamp of doubt and fear.;Anne Lamott;fear 22291;I have a big fear of change, or negative change, anyway. I’m basically the same person I was when I won ‘Idol,’ or when I was 10.;Kelly Clarkson;fear 22292;When Christians start thinking about Jesus, things start breaking down, they lose their faith.

They fear that if they ask questions they’ll lose their Christ, the very linchpin of their religion.;A. N. Wilson;fear 22293;I was taught that to create anything you had to believe in failure, simply because you had to be prepared to go through an idea without any fear.

I go out there, I want to kill the competitors. I want to make their lives miserable. I want to steal their market share. I want them to fear me and I want everyone on my team thinking we’re going to win.;Kevin O’Leary;fear 22301;Fear is not a good teacher. The lessons of fear are quickly forgotten.;Mary Catherine Bateson;fear 22302;I had to confront my fears and master my every demonic thought about inferiority, insecurity, or the fear of being black, young, and gifted in this Western culture.;Lauryn Hill;fear 22303;Let us go forth with fear and courage and rage to save the world.;Grace Paley;fear 22304;My main concern with the condition of mathematics in high school is that there’s a lot of fear involved!

There’s the one monitoring the distance between myself and the camera, making sure I hit my marks, and there is the one driven by this inner fire, this delicious fear.;Jeanne Moreau;fear 22308;Shock, confusion, fear, anger, grief, and defiance. On Sept. 11, 2001, and for the three days following the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, President George W. Bush led with raw emotion that reflected the public’s whipsawing stages of acceptance.;Ron Fournier;fear 22309;We, the people. Manifest Destiny. Conceived in liberty. Fear itself. Ask not. Morning in America. United we stand. Yes, we can. In times of great change and tumult, presidents seek to inspire beleaguered Americans by reminding them of their national identity.;Ron Fournier;fear 22310;Eighty percent of all choices are based on fear. Most people don’t choose what they want they choose what they think is safe.;Phil McGraw;fear 22311;Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason’s imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work.;Louis Aragon;fear 22312;We tell lies when we are afraid… afraid of what we don’t know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing that we fear grows stronger.;Tad Williams;fear 22313;Man’s loneliness is but his fear of life.;Eugene O’Neill;fear 22314;I think I’m a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking.
