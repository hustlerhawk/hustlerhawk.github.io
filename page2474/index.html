        <a href="/2020/02/08/1877" rel="permalink">Chasing Amy’ was an amazing role, but then after that, I went and did ‘Big Daddy’ and you’re the girlfriend or you’re the best friend. I wasn’t getting the Nicole Kidman roles.;Joey Lauren Adams;amazing 2720;The Academy Awards was an amazing night. I know I kind of lost my mind a little bit. I apologize for that. That night went so fast I can’t remember what I said or what happened.;Cuba Gooding, Jr.;amazing 2721;It’s pretty amazing to me that my first hit record was an Elvis Presley record.;Mac Davis;amazing 2722;It’s great that in the German language I’ve sold almost 30 million books. Isn’t that amazing?;Ken Follet;amazing 2723;I think women are amazing and women’s friendships are like a sisterhood and we should see more of it in television and film.;Laurie Holden;amazing 2724;It’s just amazing to do something that’s part of a pop culture phenomenon.;Chaske Spencer;amazing 2725;I just want to work forever. I absolutely love what I’m doing. I learn all the time from all these amazing artists.;Juno Temple;amazing 2726;You know, Johnny Depp has always been a massive inspiration for me and he’s somebody who has produced an incredible amount of work, and every single piece that he does is amazing.;Jamie Campbell Bower;amazing 2727;There’s such an array of brilliant roles for young women. You read all these amazing young women going through different stages in their life - different stages, different fascinations, different textualities, different friendships.;Juno Temple;amazing 2728;I just did a part in ‘Sin City 2.’ I got to do a scene with Ray Liotta. Amazing man, extraordinary gentleman who was just so kind to me… I’m so excited about that I think it’s gonna be very cool.;Juno Temple;amazing 2729;The thing that’s tricky is sometimes the best voices - just because someone hits the big notes and sounds amazing - it doesn’t necessarily mean they make the greatest artists.;Kara DioGuardi;amazing 2730;I love MySpace it’s done an amazing job for me and it’s been insane over the past couple of weeks, but I’m not a poster girl for them.;Lily Allen;amazing 2731;Actually, we got signed in November of 2000 with Dreamworks which is the most amazing label. We have friends on other labels and though we are not selling millions of records, yet, they treat us with tons of respect and give us some very good guidance.;Adam Rich;amazing 2732;I liked the way they treated the first, second, and third place finishers equally. It was an amazing year. I only entered two song contests this year I won one and placed second in the other. And I entered each of them a day or two before the deadline.;Arthur Godfrey;amazing 2733;Winning ‘The Apprentice’ changed my life in ways I could never have imagined. It has been an amazing experience working for Donald Trump and I am very grateful for the whole opportunity.;Bill Rancic;amazing 2734;It’s amazing how everyone has an opinion on how you should live your life.;Sherry Stringfield;amazing 2735;The racing driver’s mind has to have the ability to have amazing anticipation, coordination, and reflex. Because of the speed the car goes.;Emerson Fittipaldi;amazing 2736;Well, it was the beginning of my film career. It was amazing to me that I got nominated for an Academy Award.;Sally Kellerman;amazing 2737;It doesn’t take money to have style, it just takes a really good eye. Sometimes you can find amazing culinary antiques that will make it feel like an old French kitchen.;Tyler Florence;amazing 2738;’Game of Thrones’ is an amazing show, and I have no problem speaking of the virtues of HBO.;Peter Dinklage;amazing 2739;I thoroughly enjoyed working on Enemy of the State. Tony Scott is an important director, and has an amazing ability to express himself, and he doesn’t do it in musical terms , he does it in emotional terms. I got along really well with him.;Trevor Rabin;amazing 2740;Innovation is this amazing intersection between someone’s imagination and the reality in which they live. The problem is, many companies don’t have great imagination, but their view of reality tells them that it’s impossible to do what they imagine.;Ron Johnson;amazing 2741;My older brother Mike is an excellent trumpet player. By the time he was 12, he was playing around Kansas City in classical situations. He was already an amazing talent.;Pat Metheny;amazing 2742;I was about 14, and my friend’s stepdad asked me to do a 10K with him because his son - who was more into basketball - didn’t want to. It was amazing, and I still remember the time I got: 48:23.;Sean Astin;amazing 2743;It’s amazing to see places like Madison Square Garden on the schedule again.;Roger Andrew Taylor;amazing 2744;I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we’ve met a few times. I think he’s amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he’s made mistakes. He’s cool.;Cheryl Cole;amazing 2745;I would love to work with Anthony Hopkins I would love to work with Meryl Streep I would love to work with DeNiro I would love to work with Johnny Depp I’d love to work with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow… I think she’s amazing.;Tara Reid;amazing 2746;At first I missed it, but it was the amazing energy thing that happened during shows, when a lot of people were like Yay Yay Yeah! I missed that for a while. But I don’t miss the regular and the business side of that whole thing.;Bill Kreutzmann;amazing 2747;I like making films about old people because they are repositories of amazing stories that they tell well. And they’re incredibly good telly.;Ian Hislop;amazing 2748;The opportunity, number one, to work with Ang Lee is an amazing thing for me.;Sam Elliott;amazing 2749;James Franco has this interesting and relaxed look. It’s pretty ‘I don’t care,’ but it still looks good. Ryan Gosling also has amazing style. I take a lot of my fashion tips from those two. In my opinion, they’re the ones getting it right.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2750;My grandfather was one of the most amazing Baptist ministers in history, he was unbelievable. He was one of the most amazing men - the most amazing man that I ever met… He lived an amazing life.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2751;I spend up to two hours a day on correspondence. Hearing from fans on the Internet and being able to directly respond to the fan base is exciting. You can cut out the middle man like the fan club… before a recent appearance in Tyler, Texas, I had fans reaching out on MySpace offering their lake house, Mavericks tickets. It was amazing.;Josh Henderson;amazing 2752;It was a wonderful experience to work with Sylvia. She pushed me to be more powerful with my acting, and she told me scores of the most incredible stories I’ve ever heard. She is amazing.;Lukas Haas;amazing 2753;I grew up with all boys in my family, where there was no place for girlie stuff. But it’s amazing to walk into my house now. Everything is pink!;Jerry O’Connell;amazing 2754;It’s amazing how stress keeps you trim.;Peter Andre;amazing 2755;These things have a life of there own and never existed when I was growing up certainly worrying when one would get made. It’s kind of amazing how that one movie kept living through all these years.;Stockard Channing;amazing 2756;At 13, I realized that I could fix anything electronic. It was amazing, I could just do it. I started a business repairing radios. It grew to be one of the largest in Philadelphia.;Amar Bose;amazing 2757;It’s odd, because I used to see pictures, on telly or wherever, of what I now know to be Shaftesbury Avenue and I used to wonder what that amazing street with all the lights was. Well, now I know. I think when you get a wee taste of something, it maybe isn’t what you thought it was.;Shirley Henderson;amazing 2758;There was just this amazing individuality. It’s just a whole different world of optimism and fearlessness, women taking off their bras and dancing around naked, and a political hopefulness and involvement.;Jill Clayburgh;amazing 2759;The amazing thing now is that most of those so-called critics who were telling me to find my own voice seem to have lost theirs.;Brian Lumley;amazing 2760;Just going on the road and entertaining the fans, that’s amazing.;Jordan Knight;amazing 2761;If we get the capabilities, NATO, along with the European Union, can do amazing things.;Lord Robertson;amazing 2762;Acting is fantastic, but to be able to create a whole world on celluloid is amazing.

To beat Venus in Wimbledon is just something amazing.;Elena Vesnina;amazing 2765;One of the most amazing locations I’ve ever been is the top of the volcano in Tanzania, Africa. It’s an actual volcano where you really have this lava every day.;Jan de Bont;amazing 2766;Being in an area of the planet where scientists believe mankind started is quite amazing.;Jan de Bont;amazing 2767;’10’ was amazing! I had no career before ‘10’ and then all of a sudden I was able to do pretty much whatever I was able to do in the business.;Bo Derek;amazing 2768;When I see myself in the videogame it’s amazing how realistic I look. This is the most authentic and realistic soccer game I have ever seen. It is like I’m looking in a mirror. The attention to detail is incredible.;Claudio Reyna;amazing 2769;What’s amazing is that I’m recognized all over the world through ‘Red Dwarf.’ British fans are exceptional, but the American fans are something else. Some of them fly 500 miles to stand in line for three hours, just to meet me, then when they do they collapse. It makes you feel like a rock star!;Craig Charles;amazing 2770;Just knowing that through my music I actually inspire people is amazing for me and I find it very heartwarming.;Thia Megia;amazing 2771;As far as the girls in my grade, it was always kind of an on-and-off thing. When all this came up, it was kind of hard.

I’m a huge animal lover. They’re amazing.;Willow Shields;amazing 2774;I definitely look up to Meryl Streep because she’s been in so many amazing movies, and I just think that she’s one of the greatest actresses out there.

I just think it is amazing!;Atticus Shaffer;amazing 2776;I feel like I’m really blessed and lucky that I have a very good social life outside of the gym, and I have a really amazing family. My parents are so supportive. I have a younger brother and two younger sisters, and they’re really awesome. So I feel like I get the best of both worlds.;Aly Raisman;amazing 2777;Painting is the most magical of mediums. The transcendence is truly amazing to me every time I go to a museum and I see how somebody figured another way to rub colored dirt on a flat surface and make space where there is no space or make you think of a life experience.;Chuck Close;amazing 2778;Turns out, I couldn’t catch them - or even get close to them. I realized that sharks are amazing, beautiful animals who have absolutely no interest in checking me out.;Malin Akerman;amazing 2779;There were two things going on: 1) I had already established in my own mind where I wanted to go with the next series, and having James around as a Grey Eminence would have complicated matters. He had had an amazing life and it was time to bid him good-bye.;Raymond E. Feist;amazing 2780;I’m always improving and I want to get better and never hit a plateau. I find it an amazing adventure.;Nigel Kennedy;amazing 2781;I’m overly excited to finally announce this amazing global partnership deal back home with EMI Music. I know I have mentioned doing music in the past but for legal reasons I was not in a position to release any new music.;Melanie Brown;amazing 2782;The best days I have are usually days where I’m out in the woods and something happens, like I see an amazing animal like a fox, or I get a glimpse of a wild pig or something that I never see. Or crazy things happen.;Amy Ray;amazing 2783;I want to be like Tom Cruise from ‘The Outsiders’ and go on and do amazing movies for a long time.;Ashton Kutcher;amazing 2784;That’s double-edged: it’s amazing that they’re bringing me in and showing people new ideas, and at the same time it’s a little hard because seventy percent of the time or even higher I’m not going to get those roles.;Rachel True;amazing 2785;I was so happy that it filmed in New York not only because it’s an amazing city, but also because a lot of people across the world somehow started to think about New York as a dangerous place to be and envisioned it as some war zone after that happened.;Alicia Witt;amazing 2786;It’s every little girl’s dream to have an exact look-alike doll. It’s amazing.;Bindi Irwin;amazing 2787;Well, Freddie Mercury is a really huge rock star in my head. I’ve always thought he was just so tough and such an amazing entertainer, really a contradiction in many ways as well. So he was incredible.;Karen O;amazing 2788;I really enjoyed being Peppy Miller. She was an amazing character and her energy followed me everywhere. When I talk about her I want to be her again.;Berenice Bejo;amazing 2789;I’ve known Shawn for several years. And he’s just an amazing talent. He’s a great writer, a marvelous, marvelous guitar player, and plays really good fiddle.;Guy Clark;amazing 2790;It was really amazing. I mean, he’d never mentioned that he played in the symphony, like serious violin playing, not fiddle playing. And he just blew us away.;Guy Clark;amazing 2791;Yoga’s an amazing release.;Monica Keena;amazing 2792;My heroes are guys like Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. These are amazing actors with amazing careers that every actor should aspire to. I’m not saying I’m going to get anywhere close. It’s not going to be an easy feat. I’m just in awe of their careers.;Dylan O’Brien;amazing 2793;In grade school I was taught that the United States is a melting pot.

They arrive with next to nothing, work incredibly hard, learn a new language and new customs, and in a generation they become an integral part of our amazing nation.;Jeff Hawkins;amazing 2794;The greatest thing about doing this movie was that Chris and I both were involved in folk music in the ’60s. I had a group, but I don’t think it was at the same level as Chris, because he’s an amazing musician.;Eugene Levy;amazing 2795;If you spend enough time in or around Washington, you’ll meet amazing people who work for the government.;Judy Woodruff;amazing 2796;For the past 21 years, I’ve been privileged to be part of an amazing organization called the International Women’s Media Foundation.;Judy Woodruff;amazing 2797;And my first film was Carnal Knowledge, another amazing experience, largely because of Mike Nichols, who would tell me you can’t do anything wrong because you’re doing everything right.;Carol Kane;amazing 2798;I also met, early on Ella Fitzgerald. Her songbooks are some of the most amazing bodies of work.;Johnny Mathis;amazing 2799;The amazing thing is that I’m sane. I’m not bitter. I’m not drugged out. I’m not broke. I’m still married to the same guy. My children don’t hate me.;Brenda Lee;amazing 2800;It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I’ve watched her grow up and I’ve always loved her films, loved her. It was amazing working with someone who was American as well, because obviously it’s going to be a different energy straightaway. We got on really well she’s so professional and hardworking.;Kaya Scodelario;amazing 2801;I thought it was amazing to work with authors, to get a manuscript and try to make up a cover for it.;Dick Bruna;amazing 2802;I’m no actor. And I wasn’t like George Lucas or Spielberg, making home movies as a teenager, either. But I would go back and watch certain movies again and again. By the time I saw ‘The Graduate’ I was aware of how these amazing stories could be told.;Nancy Meyers;amazing 2803;I think we love bacon because it has all the qualities of an amazing sensory experience. When we cook it, the sizzling sound is so appetizing, the aroma is maddening, the crunch of the texture is so gratifying and the taste delivers every time.;Alexandra Guarnaschelli;amazing 2804;It’s amazing the relationships you forge in a kitchen. When you cooperate in an environment that’s hot. Where there’s a lot of knives. You’re trusting your well-being with someone you’ve never before met or known.;Alexandra Guarnaschelli;amazing 2805;I think for business reasons, fiscal reasons, I think these cable networks can take greater risks and I think with a risk comes better programming. And I think USA has got an amazing identity to it now that is clearly defined with its ‘Characters welcome’ tag.;Tim DeKay;amazing 2806;Everyone says, ‘You give birth, you go home, and you have this amazing baby and it’s just beautiful’. And I walked in and I just started sobbing.;Bridget Moynahan;amazing 2807;The best player I’ve ever played with was Paul Gascoigne. He had everything.

I can’t explain it, but I hope it never stops.;Chubby Checker;amazing 2824;Warren Spector is amazing, and his team is as good as any in the business. Shame to see all the revenues from their game entangled with all the madness of the Dallas office.;Mike Wilson;amazing 2825;I’m lucky that most of the time I’m on location in amazing places. Most of the time, I don’t need holidays, I just stop working.;Stephanie Beacham;amazing 2826;It is not short of amazing, the power of a great idea to weld men together.

I love the way they are. They’re consistently little boys, and they need to be nurtured and loved. But at the same time, they need to feel like men.;Krista Allen;amazing 2843;I basically left Texas with no money. I was making $3.50 working in some mall, so I didn’t have a lot of cash.
