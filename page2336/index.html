None of my books are ever just about thrills, or it won’t work.;Harlan Coben;forgiveness 24173;To sin offers repentance and forgiveness not to sin offers only punishment.;Jose Bergamin;forgiveness 24174;I like cast iron coated with enamel for longevity and forgiveness if I happen to take my eyes off the prize while pouring Chianti.;Mario Batali;forgiveness 24175;One important theme is the extent to which one can ever correct an error, especially outside any frame of religious forgiveness. All of us have done something we regret - how we manage to remove that from our conscience, or whether that’s even possible, interested me.;Ian Mcewan;forgiveness 24176;Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend.;Jewel;forgiveness 24177;Well, I’ve never left my faith - but have I made a lot of mistakes? But was I fortunate that I was brought up in that Pentecostal church, where I heard about God’s love and God’s forgiveness.;Billy Ray Cyrus;forgiveness 24178;On the Day of Atonement, Jews are commanded to seek forgiveness from the people we have hurt.;Laura Schlessinger;forgiveness 24179;The Dalai Lama’s entire being is about peace and harmony, forgiveness and self-discipline. Those are qualities to be admired. I am really looking forward to meeting His Holiness.;Joe Nichols;forgiveness 24180;As we know, forgiveness of oneself is the hardest of all the forgivenesses.;Joan Baez;forgiveness 24181;I think it is important that we rebuild an atmosphere of forgiveness and civility in every aspect of our lives.;T. D. Jakes;forgiveness 24182;I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior. I believe that Jesus died for my sins, and rose again, and that’s my belief. I still don’t know what ‘Christian’ means. I’m a follower of Christ, but I keep making a whole bunch of mistakes. And I thank God for forgiveness.;Sherri Shepherd;forgiveness 24183;I ask the people of Connecticut for their forgiveness, I should have paid more attention to people around me and people that I trusted but I am sorry for my actions and take full responsibility.;John Rowland;forgiveness 24184;God’s forgiveness is the only thing. And, well, I take full responsibility for the adultery. It was my fault and, you know, no matter what went on, the man has to take responsibility and I do.;Jim Bakker;forgiveness 24185;Well, of course I think people can be forgiven. But our justice system is not set up to dispense forgiveness. You can go to the local priest for that.;Nancy Grace;forgiveness 24186;Forgiveness isn’t about condoning what has happened to you or someone else’s actions against you.;Jennifer O’Neill;forgiveness 24187;Sometimes I see myself fine, sometimes I need a witness.

My only hope is that some good can come out of my situation.;Jayson Blair;forgiveness 24190;I’m a lapsed Quaker. I don’t go to meetings any more. But I’m very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I’d love to be a Catholic. I think it would be fantastic - faith, forgiveness, absolution, extreme unction - all these wonderful words. I don’t think anyone who was ever born a Catholic hasn’t died a Catholic, no matter how lapsed they are.;Kate Atkinson;forgiveness 24191;China’s idea of fair trade is government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports to the United States, currency manipulation, and forgiveness of loans by its government banks.;Virginia Foxx;forgiveness 24192;The things the writers have me doing on ‘Suburgatory’ are insane. I think they think it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.;Cheryl Hines;forgiveness 24193;I would say that playing this character has caused me to think about a lot of things. He’s always questioning himself and trying to get back to something he lost touch with and trying to find forgiveness. Everybody struggles with these things to some extent in their life.;Lee Tergesen;forgiveness 24194;I’m currently in an interesting correspondence with a nun about forgiveness.;Julian Clary;forgiveness 24195;I invite everyone to chose forgiveness rather than division, teamwork over personal ambition.;Jean-Francois Cope;forgiveness 24196;I would say the hierarchy has made terrible errors in judgment and it has to seek forgiveness by its members.;William P. Leahy;forgiveness 24197;I think everything worked out the way it was supposed to. Mark’s happier. I’m sober. There are still phone calls to be made, people I need to say something to.
